Applikationsområden inkluderar mönsterigenkänning, datorseende, tal‐ och språkförståelse. När utvecklingen inom bilindustrin går mot en ökad grad av automatisering, blir problemen som måste lösas alltmer komplexa, vilket har lett till ett ökat användande av metoder från maskininlärning och deep learning. Med detta tillvägagångssätt lär sig systemet lösningen till ett problem implicit från träningsdata och man kan inte direkt utvärdera lösningens korrekthet. Detta innebär problem när systemet i fråga är del av en säkerhetskritisk funktion, vilket är fallet för självkörande fordon. Detta examensarbete behandlar säkerhetsaspekter relaterade till maskininlärningssystem i autonoma fordon och applicerar en safety monitoring‐metodik på en kollisionsundvikningsfunktion. Simuleringar utförs, med ett deep learning‐system som del av systemet för perception, som ger underlag för styrningen av fordonet, samt en safety monitor för kollisionsundvikning. De relaterade operationella situationerna och säkerhetsvillkoren studeras för en autonom körnings‐funktion, där potentiella fel i det lärande systemet introduceras och utvärderas. Vidare introduceras ett förslag på ett mått på trovärdighet hos det lärande systemet under drift. </p><h4><p> ii </p></h4><p> </p><h4><p> iii </p></h4><p> Master of Science Thesis MMK 2017:149 MES 015 </p><p>Safety of Machine Learning Systems in Autonomous Driving </p><p> </p><h4><p> Fadi Al-Khoury </p></h4><p>Approved </p><p>Examiner </p><h4><p>Martin Törngren</p></h4><p> </p><p>Supervisor </p><h4><p>De-Jiu Chen</p></h4><p> </p><p> Commissioner </p><p>Contact person </p><h2><p>Abstract </p></h2><p>Machine Learning, and in particular Deep Learning, are extremely capable tools for solving problems which are difficult, or intractable to tackle analytically. Application areas include pattern recognition, computer vision, speech and natural language processing. With the automotive industry aiming for increasing amount of automation in driving, the problems to solve become increasingly complex, which appeals to the use of supervised learning methods from Machine Learning and Deep Learning. With this approach, solutions to the problems are learned implicitly from training data, and inspecting their correctness is not possible directly. This presents concerns when the resulting systems are used to support safety-critical functions, as is the case with autonomous driving of automotive vehicles. This thesis studies the safety concerns related to learning systems within autonomous driving and applies a safety monitoring approach to a collision avoidance scenario. Experiments are performed using a simulated environment, with a deep learning system supporting perception for vehicle control, and a safety monitor for collision avoidance. The related operational situations and safety constraints are studied for an autonomous driving function, with potential faults in the learning system introduced and examined. Also, an example is considered for a measure that indicates trustworthiness of the learning system during operation. </p><h4><p> iv </p></h4><p> </p><h4><p> v </p></h4><h2><p>Acknowledgements </p></h2><p>I would like to thank all the people who contributed in some way to this thesis project.

Automation systems are needed to deliver important functions that can be safety critical. Safety concerns become more difficult to tackle when the solutions to complex automation problems emerge from deep learning or machine learning, and involve elements that are non deterministic, and difficult to inspect for correctness. The research questions are formulated in this section, along with the corresponding delimitations. An outline of the thesis is then presented, followed by a list of contributions.\n</p><p>Automation is expected to continue to take on important functions in various products and services used by society. In safety-critical applications, faults in automation can have great consequences such as loss of life, damage to property, and financial losses. The safety of such systems needs to be assured with good confidence. The focus of this thesis is particularly on automation within autonomous driving. The SAE J3016 standard [1] describes five levels of driving automation, ranging from basic driver assistance in level 1, to full automation under all driving situations in level 5. The commercially available technology is currently at level 2, and higher levels are being developed. Audi has recently announced its A8 model for 2018 featuring level 3 automation [2]. With level 3, automated systems control the vehicle and monitor the environment under some driving modes, but a human driver is expected to intervene when requested as a fall-back measure.\n</p><p>Embedded systems are essential to many automation functionalities in autonomous vehicles. Several definitions exist for embedded systems, and more commonly relate to hardware and software aspects. For example, [3] offers a concise definition where \"Embedded systems are systems which include a computer but are not used for general purpose computing.\" From a systems engineering perspective, a definition that can be suitable for the context of functional safety in autonomous driving is that an embedded system is \"a system that is part of a larger system and performs some special purpose for that system (in contrast to a general-purpose part that is meant to be continuously configured to meet the demands of its users)\" [4]. Common in applications with embedded systems is the requirement for real-time interaction with the world. Several subjects areas assist in the systematic design of embedded systems for safety: safety engineering, systems engineering, formal methods, and software testing.\n</p><p>Apart from safety, also several ethical and legal matters need to be considered when driving decisions are provided by algorithms. An interesting dilemma is discussed in [5] regarding how an algorithm should choose between two evils. This includes cases such as whether the algorithm should decide to sacrifice the vehicle's passengers in order to save a greater number of other people, or should it decide to protect the passengers at all cost. The answer to such a question depends on moral and philosophical viewpoints that vary across societies and individuals. A new General Data Protection Regulation, summarized in [6], is planned to be enforced across the EU in 2018. In this law, the user should be able to obtain an explanation regarding an algorithmic decision made on his/her behalf.\n</p><p>Several technologies are employed in the automotive industry and academia for monitoring the vehicle's environment, which include cameras, Radar, Lidar, and ultra-sonic sensors. The sensor data is fed to algorithms that support various functionalities, which may be of high relevance to safety. These algorithms may also be highly complex, making them difficult to analyze. The problem associated with using the sensor data for achieving the required functions is not possible to solve analytically for real world scenarios due to large input spaces (e.g. all combinations of pixel values). For such problems, solutions have emerged from the fields of Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and\nstatistical signal processing. These approaches share a probabilistic paradigm. Depending on the method used, the probabilistic factors may or may not need to be explicitly treated when solving the problem. The answers are for some methods described in terms of probability distributions, while for other methods probabilistic factors affect the solution implicitly and are not indicated in the answers. This is especially the case with deep learning, where labeled data is used to train an artificial neural network to solve the problem. This thesis refers to systems utilizing probabilistic methods from these three fields as Learning Systems, and focuses explicitly on methods using supervised learning with labeled data used for training or statistical analysis.\n</p><p>When automation is used to drive the vehicle, there are several possible points of failure in the system. These include hardware and software malfunction, problems with network delays/synchronization, mechanical problems, and also the behavior of the learning systems used. Investigating the safety impacts of these elements in the real world for autonomous driving can be infeasible and also dangerous. This motivates alternative methods that instead involve the use of simulations. Of relevance also is the ISO 26262 [7] standard, which covers functional safety for electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems in passenger vehicles, including software. This thesis focuses on the safety concerns with using learning systems in autonomous driving. The next section introduces the research questions that will be addressed.\n</p><h4><p>1.1 Research Questions\n</p></h4><p>The research questions investigated in this thesis are stated as follows:\n</p><p>1. What are the concerns when learning systems are used in safety critical applications, specifically in the pursuit of higher levels of autonomous driving (SAE level 3 and higher)?\n</p><p>• Learning algorithms are affected by probabilistic factors inherent in their design. What are the concerns if we need to assure their safety in high-criticality automotive applications?\n</p><p>• What are the implications when we need to comply with ISO 26262, specifically with regard to clauses 7 and 8 of part 3, which address hazard analysis, risk assessment, and the functional safety concept?\n</p><p>2. Given the challenges with regards to safety-assurance of learning systems, what solutions can be considered?\n</p><p>• What are the prominent formal methods approaches, and how can we assess their suitability for different applications? For example: is it helpful to use methods that verify mathematical properties of inputs and outputs for the learning system, or is it more appropriate to introduce other architectural elements, such as safety monitors, that address behavioral/functional properties?\n</p><p>• Using an example deep learning system in a speed control application, how could we design a simple safety monitoring solution that is feasible for this scenario. Would the monitor design complexity present challenges?\n</p><p>3. Due to cost and safety considerations for prototyping autonomous speed control systems in a physical environment, how can simulations assist in testing safety monitors and learning systems? What are the needed elements in the simulator to support safety studies of vision based learning systems? What commercial tools can we identify and test for this setup?\n</p><h4><p>1.2 Delimitations\n</p></h4><p>Some delimitations were made in order to better address the main focus of this work, while others had to be imposed due to limited project time and resources. Below is a list of the delimitations.\n</p><p>• The aim in this project is to study safety concerns with (supervised) learning systems and how safety can be assured for an example automotive application. Designing a high performing learning system is not a primary objective, and could even defeat the purpose of our investigation. Beyond achieving basic performance for conducting experiments, optimizing performance can also use up excess project time, considering the limited computational resources available.\n</p><p>• A discussion is presented regarding clauses 7 and 8 of the ISO 26262 part 3, which relate to hazard analysis and functional safety at the concept phase. Other parts of the standard are not discussed unless there is a need to reference them. The focus is on studying safety for learning systems at a conceptual level rather than undertaking product development activities.\n</p><p>• Although a safety monitoring strategy is developed for the general scenario of combined longitudinal and lateral motion, only the simpler frontal collision avoidance monitoring is tested in simulations.\n</p><p>• The approach presented in this thesis uses a model of the leading vehicle's expected future trajectory in collision avoidance. However, this is not addressed in any depth, and only the case of a fixed leading vehicle is considered.\n</p><p>• Fault tolerance within the control system by incorporating sensor fusion using different types of sensors is not considered. Although the simplicity of the design presented in Section 4.2 could be criticized, the focus in this thesis is not on sensor solutions yielding high robustness and performance, but rather is on the fundamental safety challenges with learning systems, and handling faults at an architectural level.\n</p><p>• A prototype vision-based speed control system will be developed in later sections. Imperfections in the image data due to noise, distortions, motion blur, are not incorporated, as this introduces unneeded variables to the study, and also increases computational demands in preparing experiments. The main interest is in the fundamental safety concerns when deploying learning systems in safety critical applications. Noise or imperfect data is a problem that is not specific to learning systems. Also for safety monitoring, the focus is on the functionality assuming perfect input information.\n</p><p>• An example measure is discussed and tested as an indicator of the learning system's trustworthiness during operation. The development of better indicators, or the investigation of desired properties of such indicators has not been attempted in this work.\n</p><h4><p>1.3 Research Method\n</p></h4><p>To address the goals for this thesis, literature is examined on relevant topics and a demo is built in a simulation environment. Relevant literature is identified on learning systems, especially with regard to safety and how the problem can be defined in the context of safety. Also, the types of learning systems that are most relevant in autonomous driving are identified, along with particular safety concerns with their use. The ISO 26262 is consulted for a recommendation on how to meet safety goals given the challenges with assuring the safety of learning systems. Literature is also examined on formal methods, and how they can fit into safety assurance for autonomous driving, beginning\nwith the SMOF approach [8, 9] which is of interest at the Embedded Control Systems devision at KTH. The knowledge and experience gained is then demoed in a virtual vehicle simulation setup, and experiments are performed to further examine the safety concerns and seek insights.\n</p><h4><p>1.4 Thesis Outline\n</p></h4><p>This thesis studies the safety concerns with learning systems delivering critical functionalities in autonomous driving, and investigates an architectural approach for meeting safety requirements. This section introduces the topic of safety in the context of autonomous driving, and the use of learning systems in safety-critical applications. Section 2 discusses the safety concerns, as well as the use of learning systems for autonomous driving. This is followed by a discussion of the ISO 26262 standard and the architectural approach to addressing safety is considered. Section 2.3 reviews the literature on safety monitoring and identifies a promising approach. Section 3 applies the safety monitoring approach to the context of collision avoidance. A case study is presented in Section 4, in which simulation is used to support safety studies of safety monitoring and control. The control system considered uses camera images as input, and utilizes deep learning. An indicator is presented for the trustworthiness of the learning system during operation. Experiments are then performed to study safety and test collision avoidance. Finally, Section 5 discusses and summarizes the work in this thesis, and offers suggestions for further research.\n</p><h4><p>1.5 Contributions\n</p></h4><p>The contributions of this thesis are the following:\n</p><p>• A discussion is made of the safety concerns with deploying learning systems in safety critical automotive applications in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. Safety monitoring approaches are also discussed along with their complexity considerations in Section 2.3.\n</p><p>• Models for longitudinal as well as combined longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance scenarios are developed and used within a safety monitoring approach in Section 3.1.\n</p><p>• An approach to safety distance calculation based on time varying relative acceleration models is presented in Section 3.2. Constant acceleration models are shown to offer relatively optimistic safety distances in comparison, which is not desirable.\n</p><p>• The use of simulations for supporting safety studies of camera-based learning systems is discussed in Section 4.1, and three simulation tools, IPG CarMaker, TESIS DYNAware, and TASS PreScan are considered for this application.\n</p><p>• A simulation-based approach is presented in Section 4.3 for performing safety studies with camera-based vehicle control, where a full control and safety toolchain can be tested. Experiments with malfunctioning behaviors in a vision-based speed control system are also presented. An architectural safety monitoring approach is applied and demonstrated for collision avoidance in case of hazardous speed control behavior.\n</p><p>• An example runtime indicator is presented in Section 4.3.4, for the trustworthiness of a vision-based speed control system. Such an indicator can help warn in advance before severe safety interventions are needed.\n</p><h3><p>2 Background\n</p></h3><p>This section presents the background relevant to the discussions of this thesis. A function approximation view of learning systems is introduced and used to discuss safety concerns. Applications for learning systems in autonomous driving are then discussed, with particular mention of the end-to-end approach to solving automation problems, and the safety implications that arise. The ISO 26262 is discussed for this context, and an architectural approach to safety is considered. Safety monitoring is then introduced, and a promising approach in the literature is identified.\n</p><p>Although developments in automation may yield good performance, and even eliminate sources of human error, there are several sources of failures that introduce hazards. For the case where the automation systems employ learning algorithms, these sources can include unreliable sensors, problems with the data used for training, as well as limitations in the algorithms and faults in their design.\n</p><p>With regard to the learning systems addressed in this thesis, Vapnik [10] provides a definition that is helpful in this context. In Vapnik's paper, learning is posed as a problem of function approximation involving three components:\n</p><p>1. A generator of random vectors x, drawn independently from a fixed but unknown distribution P (x).\n</p><p>2. A supervisor which returns an output vector y to every input vector x, according to a conditional distribution function P (y|x), also fixed but unknown.\n</p><p>3. A learning machine capable of implementing a set of functions f(x,w), where w ∈W is a set of parameters to be learned.\n</p><p>To illustrate these components in an example application, consider the case where a deep neural network classifies input images. The generator would be the training images used to train the network, with each image being a vector x in Vapnik's model. The supervisor would be the ground truth labeling process for the training images, where the class label is encoded in the output vector y referred to above. A commonly used distinction in machine learning literature is between supervised and unsupervised learning. In the former, ground truth labels are available, as is the case in our image classification example. With unsupervised learning on the other hand, ground truth labels are not available and other mechanisms are used. A key point is that P (y|x) is unknown, and in effect sampled for available x vectors. Finally, the implementation of the particular deep neural network architecture would constitute the learning machine. The term w refers to the network parameters such as the weights and biases. The resulting output of the neural network, depends on the input image x, and the network parameters w used, which are determined by the training process. The concept of learning systems discussed in this thesis uses this function approximation view of supervised learning. A discussion is presented in [11, 12] on the critical role of training data and loss functions, which represent training objectives, for the safety of machine learning systems. For the loss functions, the authors note that with quantities related to performance or prediction error, the human cost that is relevant for safety may not be accounted for. For example, consider the trivial scenario where the steering angle for a vehicle is learned by a neural network from labeled data. The quantities relevant for safety may include the risk of collision, and the risk of injury or death, which depend on the operating environment. If the backpropagation method is used with the angle error alone, these\nsafety considerations are not incorporated in the loss function. Also, arguments based on laws of large numbers (e.g. average error) may not be suitable when considering safety, since safety-critical cases may be rare and underrepresented in an aggregate quantity. Two concerns are noted by the authors for the training data\n</p><p>• The training samples may not be drawn from the underlying distribution, P (y|x). For the image classification example, consider the case when the training images are produced by ideal sensors, and contain no noise, distortions, or motion blur, but the actual P (y|x) needed for the application is for non-ideal realistic images. By using ideal training images, the training samples were drawn from a different distribution than P (y|x). In addition, the difference between the target distribution and the distribution from which training samples are drawn may not be easily understood or possible to account for.\n</p><p>• The training samples are absent in parts of the x vector space. This can especially be the case for rare, low probability, x regions. Safety relevant rare conditions may be insufficiently represented, or not represented at all.\n</p><p>There may be other concerns the authors do not explicitly include, such as the formulation of the learning problem with adequate and suitable information to infer outputs. This can be viewed as sampling from P (y|z) when P (y|x) is the needed distribution for the problem. If the mapping between z and x is many-to-one, then simply extra training data would be needed. If the mapping is one-to-many, or many-to-many then nondeterminism is introduced, affecting the potential for inferring the output. Overfitting is another problem in supervised learning, which is related to the complexity of the learned system (e.g. the number of weights) relative to the amount of training data. A complex model can fit exactly a set of points that draw a straight line with an added noise, however, it will generalize very poorly on unseen data compared to a simple model for a straight line. This can be related to the discussion on the loss functions. When using only the error in the loss function, the complex model would be favored, however, an additional term can be incorporated to avoid overfitting by penalizing model complexity. This technique is known as regularization. Overfitting can also be related to causality and interpretability. The higher model complexity can allow for fitting noise and vagaries in the training data that are not part of the underlying physics, and also make the model more difficult to understand.\n</p><p>The authors suggest four strategies for improving safety:\n</p><p>• Inherently Safe Design Causality and interpretability can be insisted on in the design of systems, which allows for the behavior of the models in response to inputs to be understood and verified. Irrelevant input and output variables need to be eliminated, to expose the main \"physics\" of the system governing its functional and safety properties. Interpretability refers to the possibility of understanding the models and their operation, for e.g. whether a model is black box, gray box, white box, etc. Interpretable models can much more easily be examined with respect to safety or other properties. The authors, do not include causality as a safety concern beside the training data and loss functions above, but it can contribute an offset between the target and training data distributions. For example, consider the case discussed in the previous paragraph regarding sampling from P (y|z) when P (y|x) is the needed instead.\n</p><p>• Safety Reserves In [11, 12], this refers to optimizing not only with respect to the model parameters, but also with respect to uncertainties in training data. A practical example is not suggested, but the key is to consider the worst case outcome while varying uncertainties, whether due to training and test distribution mismatch or instantiation of the test set. It is also suggested to consider fairness and equitability, so that certain groups are not underrepresented for safety.\n</p><p>• Safe Fail With this strategy, the system may elect a reject option, in which it does not attempt to predict the output for the given input sample. For example, in regions that are too close to decision boundaries, or regions that correspond to rare input conditions, a safe fail would be to ask the human operator to intervene.\n</p><p>• Procedural Safeguards User experience design can help guide practitioners on how to correctly setup the machine learning system. This includes the training data set, evaluation procedures, and other elements. If automated design processes are performed by users who are not deeply knowledgeable of the systems and associated safety concerns, incorrect use can be a concern. Another procedural safeguard is to have the possibility of public audit of source code, so that potential problems can be discovered. Having the data source publicly available is also suggested by the authors.\n</p><p>The next section discusses some autonomous driving applications from the literature with regard to safety. Following this, the relevant safety standard for such applications is considered, and then the topic of safety monitoring is introduced.\n</p><h4><p>2.1 Safety Issues When Using Learning Systems for Autonomous Driving\n</p></h4><p>A pioneering work in this area is [13] from 1989, where a neural network computes the steering angle for a vehicle using camera and laser rangefinder inputs. This approach later came to be called end-to-end learning, since the algorithms are not hand designed. After the introduction of convolutional neural networks (CNN), end-to-end learning was utilized in a famous project by LeCun et al. [14], to drive a model truck on unknown open terrain while avoiding obstacles. More recently, advancements have been made in CNNs for vision tasks, which were driven by improvements in computational resources and network designs with more hidden layers. Networks with large amount of layers are referred to as \"deep\" networks in the literature, with the corresponding phrase \"deep learning\" also used. [15] used Deep CNN for end-to-end steering in lane and road following.\n</p><p>The main attraction with the end-to-end approach is that no domain expertise is required on how the system should solve the problem. Although some expertise would be required for selecting a suitable training data set and loss functions for the problem, the process for solving the problem is inferred implicitly from data.\n</p><p>Relating to the interpretability concept mentioned earlier, end-to-end systems can be viewed as uninterpretable, black box, computations. Consider that solving the main problem controlling a vehicle using vision information consists of several logical subproblems, such as: lane tracking, scene understanding, vehicle state awareness, coordinating with other vehicles, action policy, and others. The logic of how an end-to-end system solves the main problem is not understood, neither is the correctness of the solutions to each logical subproblem. This presents a safety concern in its own right, and compounds the previously mentioned challenges regarding adequate training data.\n</p><p>For safety, training data needs to cover rare cases that exercise all logical subsystems of an end-to-end system. To illustrate the challenge, consider a problem composed of two subproblems: PA and PB. Since with end-to-end systems the solutions to the subproblems are not inspected separately, faults in one subproblem may be masked in the aggregate system. Consider fault FA which affects the solution to PA. Due to a masking affect, this particular fault may not always be detected in the aggregate system. Rather than requiring simply that the training data accounts for FA, in an end-to-end system the data needs to exercise FA such that it is detectable in the aggregate system. The rarity of needed data could be much higher than if subproblems could be inspected separately. As the complexity of problems increases for end-to-end systems, it becomes increasingly harder to alleviate safety concerns associated with adequate training data.\n</p><p>Analytical methods for verification of properties of deep networks have been proposed in the literature [16, 17]. However, these methods use a mathematical view of the system's inputs and outputs, where one needs to specify safety properties concerning the values of input pixels and output quantities. Even if this could be achieved, the likely complex methods required for deriving such specifications would need verification efforts of their own.\n</p><p>Next, a brief discussion is presented of some relevant portions of the ISO 26262 safety standard, in relation to safety critical autonomous driving applications.\n</p><h4><p>2.2 The ISO 26262 Standard\n</p></h4><p>As the automotive industry aims at higher levels of automation, there is a trend of increasing complexity in the various software, hardware, and mechatronic systems deployed in vehicles. Due to the challenges in scaling the safety assurance with system complexity, as well as the critical application areas involved, safety becomes increasingly a major issue. The ISO 26262 [7] standard addresses the functional safety of electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems within road vehicles, which for example include systems for: driver assistance, propulsion, and vehicle dynamics control. Safety requirements can be at the technical or functional level. Technical safety requirements pertain to safety of systems at the technical implementation level, and can for example include: voltage limits, memory requirements, speed ranges, safety distances, reaction times, etc. Functional safety requirements, on the other hand is implementation-independent, and relates to a higher level of abstraction which addresses behaviors of systems in response to inputs. This can involve, for example: actuator actions, computational flow within software, and transitions across system states. For functional safety, the system as a whole needs to be considered, along with the environment in which it operates.\n</p><p>The aim in the ISO 26262 is to assure the absence of unreasonable risk due to hazards caused by malfunctioning behavior of E/E systems, including software. The standard provides an automotive safety lifecycle, with a framework for the elimination of hazards and minimizing residual risk. The Safety Integrity Level is an important concept in the standard, pertaining to the amount of rigor in safety requirements that would be suitable for the amount of risk involved. Also, requirements for validation of safety and for relations with suppliers are addressed in the ISO 26262.\n</p><p>An overview of the ISO 26262 is shown in Figure 1. For the safety studies of learning systems presented in this thesis, the clauses in the standard which are most relevant are clauses 7 and 8 of part 3, addressing hazard analysis and functional safety at the concept phase of product development. The focus of this work is on the fundamental concerns with the use of learning systems. Safety within management, product development, and production activities is not of direct relevance, and is hence not discussed.\n</p><p>Figure 1: ISO 26262 overview [7]. Copyright remains with ISO (used with permission).\n</p><p>2.2.1 Hazard analysis, risk assessment and ASIL determination\n</p><p>In the ISO 26262, the term \"item\" is used to refer to a system or array of systems that implements a function at the vehicle level, and to which the standard is applied. The item of interest in the investigations presented in this thesis can be defined as the autonomous driving function achieved via learning systems, without specifying any particular choice of learning systems, or the type of input and interfaces they involve. An example of such an item discussed in Section 4 is a speed control system using a deep neural network vision system. That item takes camera images of the road as input, and outputs brake and acceleration levels.\n</p><p>During hazard analysis and risk assessment the item is evaluated without internal safety mechanisms, with regard to its potential hazardous events (i.e. combinations of hazards and operational situations). Hazards that can result also from foreseeable misuse shall be analyzed. The hazards that can be triggered by malfunctions in the item are identified, and safety goals for the prevention or mitigation of the hazardous events are formulated.\n</p><p>The standard requires for hazards to be determined systematically. Some hazard analysis techniques mentioned in the standard are Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Hazardous events and their associated safety goals are assigned Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs), which are determined according to an assessment of the severity, probability of exposure, and controllability of the hazards. Figure 2 shows the classification classes for these factors.\n</p><p>Figure 2: ISO 26262 classification of hazardous events [7].\n</p><p>Exposure and controllability assessments use estimates for the probability of exposure to hazardous situations, and the probability of avoiding harm, respectively. For classes E1-E4 and C1-C3, the difference in probability from one class to the next is an order of magnitude. It has been suggested in [18] to avoid probabilistic assessments as they bring in subjectivity for assumptions and analyses about the system, and that ASIL assessment entails a tension between safety and business competitiveness considerations for manufacturers. The assignment of ASIL in the standard using the severity, exposure, and controllability classes is shown in Figure 3.\n</p><p>In the collision avoidance scenarios discussed in this thesis, the hazard represents a situation where the vehicle may collide with obstacles due to failures in control functionalities achieved via learning systems. The corresponding safety goal is to avoid colliding with obstacles due to malfunctioning vehicle control from learning systems. Collisions can lead to fatal injuries, which are not avoidable without safety measures. This requires severity class S3, and a controllability class C3 classifications. Exposure refers to the relative frequency of exposure to the possibility of the hazard occurring. For example, hazardous events related to airbags have low exposure since airbags rarely deploy, while hazardous events related to braking systems have high exposure as braking is relevant in many driving situations. For example, an omission failure or braking, is relevant and dangerous in many driving\nsituations - thus having high exposure. In the context of safety critical learning systems used in autonomous driving, the exposure is high when essential driving functions are automated. This would require an exposure classification of E4. The ASIL that results from these severity, exposure, and controllability classifications is an ASIL D. Furthermore, a challenge when using use a data-driven design process rather than analytic methods, is the presence of not only known unknown factors, but also unknown unknowns that are difficult to account for in probability assessment.\n</p><p>Figure 3: ASIL assignment in ISO 26262 [7]\n</p><p>The ISO 26262-9:2011, Clause 5, offers an opportunity to implement safety requirements by independent architectural elements, and assign a potentially lower ASIL to the decomposed safety requirements. This is referred to as ASIL decomposition. For learning systems whose safety is difficult to analyze and verify, it can be desirable to divert away safety compliance efforts to simpler architectural elements that achieve the safety goals. For the ASIL D safety goal of avoiding collisions due to learning systems' functions, Clause 5.4.10, allows a decomposition into one ASIL D(D) requirement and one QM(D) requirement. The class QM (quality management) denotes that complying with the standard is not required. The ASIL QM(D) can be assigned to the learning system responsible for the autonomous driving functions, while an ASIL D(D) requirement can be assigned to a dedicated safety monitor for which it is simpler to assure safety compliance.\n</p><p>2.2.2 Functional safety concept\n</p><p>Clause 8 of ISO 26262-3 addresses the functional safety concept, which involves the allocation of functional safety requirements to architectural elements of the item, or to external measures. With the safety goal of avoiding collisions stated earlier decomposed into one ASIL D(D) requirement and one QM(D) requirement, an architectural element can be introduced to satisfy the ASIL D(D) requirement, while the original learning system can be exempt from needing to comply with the standard. The ASIL D(D) safety requirement can simply be to avoid colliding with obstacles. The added architectural element for this requirement can be considered as a safety monitor or a collision avoidance system.\n</p><p>The exact definition for this system would vary with implementation and technology choices, including the type of sensors used and the available system outputs. ASIL decomposition helps to divert safety assurance efforts from the complex systems that employ learning systems. However, complexity in the safety monitoring device can also increase verification efforts and should be minimized.\n</p><p>In this thesis, safety is addressed not by attempting to verify the safety properties of learning systems, and not by employing strategies that foster safety within learning systems. Instead, the idea is for safety concerns to be diverted to a separate architectural component for achieving the needed safety goals, whose verification is much simpler. Safety monitoring is considered for applications where the learning system drives the vehicle. Only accidents associated with colliding with obstacles are addressed, for which case collision avoidance is of relevance, and safety monitoring should achieve this function.\n</p><h4><p>2.3 The Safety Monitoring Approach to Safety\n</p></h4><p>Safety monitoring is not a new paradigm, although other terms have also been used to describe the approach. An early work in this area is [19] from 1987, which shows a formal methods approach that generates a supervisor from a system model and a constraint model both expressed as automata. The supervisor issues inhibitions to prevent hazardous actions. An example offered is when two users should not simultaneously access a shared resource. The objective would be to inhibit transitions in order to satisfy synchronization requirements. The authors provide a formal approach to proving that the needed supervisor exists, and that the corresponding synthesis problem is solvable.\n</p><p>Automated tools have been developed for verifying properties of automata models, known as model checkers. Model checkers exhaustively check the reachable states of the model. If the property holds, the model checker confirms it with full certainty, and provides some diagnostic information otherwise. Model checking has been used in the design of safety monitors. Siminiceanu and Ciardo [20] use their SMART model checker to verify the design and expose potential problems with the NASA airport runway safety monitor, which detects incursions and alert pilots.\n</p><p>With increasing complexity in system behavior and its environment, more descriptive models become needed, and their state space size increases. This presents a scalability challenge when using model checkers, since all the reachable states need to be checked. This is referred to as the \"state space explosion\" problem. In [20], the popular NuSMV and SPIN model checkers were found not feasible for the runway safety monitoring application with a large state space.\n</p><p>One other consideration is that embedded systems exhibit both event-driven and time-driven phenomena. To represent such systems, hybrid models are used which include both discrete and continuous variables. Model checkers for hybrid systems exist, notably [21], however the computational complexity in model checking hybrid models is larger than for discrete models, which present further scalability difficulties. In applications where an implicitly discrete view of time and other continuous variables is used (e.g. due to sampling and quantization), it can be suitable to use discrete models.\n</p><p>Runtime verification is another paradigm related to model checking. Rather than using a model checker to verify the safety monitor offline, the safety monitor checks the execution of the system online. In effect, not all possible system executions are exhaustively checked, but only those that are encountered during system operation. This provides a fault detection mechanism. A key difference with model checking is that no model for the system is needed. A runtime verification architecture is proposed in [3] for safety-critical embedded systems. In this approach, execution traces are analyzed during system operation and checked against formal specifications. A separate controller is then triggered if a violation occurs. The focus of this work is more on the technical level, relating to the technical operation of systems. An example offered by the author is the following: \"If the brake pedal has been pressed, then within 200ms cruise control should be disengaged for 100ms.\"\n</p><p>For collision avoidance, the top level safety goal is at the functional level, relating to the behavior of the vehicle within its environment. For complex scenarios, model checking can help ensure that this goal is achieved by the safety monitor, also if using runtime verification.\n</p><p>The work presented in this thesis will use the SMOF safety monitoring framework where the supervisor issues interventions, following [8, 9]. In this SMOF approach, the state space is partitioned into safe, warning, and critical regions. The safety monitor triggers interventions upon the system entering the warning regions to insure that transitions into critical regions are prevented. The authors also present an automated tool for the identification of warning states, and the synthesis of safety strategies given the available interventions. The main promise in the SMOF tool is the capability to produce a safety monitor given a system and a set of available interventions.\n</p><p>2.3.1 Application to Collision Avoidance\n</p><p>Collision avoidance (CA) requires not only the abstract safety rules that can be obtained with SMOF, but also the implementation of these rules. This includes detection and tracking of obstacles, and the needed planning and action steps for avoiding a collision. An overview of collision avoidance systems is found in [22]. It is noted that collision avoidance per se is not always attainable in automotive applications, and collision mitigation is a more realistic focus, i.e. reducing the severity of accidents. One main challenge, is defining the conditions in which the CA system should intervene. The author suggests examples where vehicles meet in a narrow road allowing little separation, and overtaking maneuvers that can be confused with imminent dangers. These challenges present a trade-off between effectiveness and unneeded interventions. Also, the work compares steering and braking maneuvers in terms of efficiency. For avoiding a head-on collision, with constant acceleration models the author shows that the needed separation distance is much higher with braking than steering as the initial speed increases. In fact, it was shown that with constant acceleration models, the separation distance is proportional to the square of velocity for braking, but linearly proportional to velocity for steering. The concept of \"decision functions\" is also presented in [22], in which dynamic models of the ego and other vehicles, as well as assumptions of future actions are basis for CA intervention decisions. Constant velocity and constant acceleration dynamic models are presented for estimating future trajectories. Several measures have been discussed for assessing the corresponding collision threat, including: distance, time to collision, closest point of approach, required acceleration, and others.\n</p><p>This thesis will present a different approach for integrating the two components, which is in alignment with the SMOF approach. Rather than using constant acceleration models, an approach will be shown involving time varying acceleration models for calculating the needed safety distance dynamically at run time, rather than only indicating a threat level or warning. This framework also allows for flexibility in defining the expectation of future actions of obstacles, which can be of help with the previously mentioned confusing scenarios (meeting at narrow roads and overtaking). However, this is not within the scope of this thesis and is not presented. In the following section, the main methodology is presented along with an example.\n</p><h3><p>3 Safety Monitoring for Collision Avoidance\n</p></h3><p>This section applies the SMOF safety monitoring approach to the context collision avoidance, both for the longitudinal (front and back) and lateral (sideways) cases. Next, the problem is formulated and the SMOF rule synthesis tool is tested with models for the two cases. The latter case will involve a much larger state space. After obtaining safety rules, the technical implementation of these rules is addressed.\n</p><h4><p>3.1 SMOF for Collision Avoidance\n</p></h4><p>In the SMOF framework, the safety system is responsible for monitoring safety and triggering interventions when the system transitions into a warning state. A formal description of the problem is presented next, but the reader may skip to Section 3.1.1 for an implementation of this approach. In the SMOF framework, the tasks may be viewed as follows:\n</p><p>1. Let the vehicle's surrounding regions be represented by a set of nondeterministic finite state machines (FSMs) Ri, i = 1, 2, 3, ...n, each possessing its own set of states Si, generators Σi, and\n</p><p>transition relations −→i with which jointly the FSMs satisfy constraints related to interdependency of different regions. Let the joint system be denoted by T = {R1, R2, R3, ..., Rn} with the space of possible states S, transition relations −→, and generators Σ. Given a catastrophic combination of the sets Sc ∈ S, obtain the set of predecessor warning states Sw\n</p><p>Sw = Pre(Sc) := { sw ∈ S : ∃σ ∈ Σ,∃sc ∈ Sc, sw σ−→ sc\n</p><p>} .\n</p><p>2. Specify the available monitor interventions that if associated to warning states sw ∈ Sw transitions into catastrophic states can be possibly canceled. This can also be viewed as introducing an additional FSM (the monitor), so that the joint system can have no catastrophic states. Let the monitor be given by M(Sm,Σm,−→m), T′ = {M,T} denotes the joint system with the monitor. The monitor's states are derived from the states of Ri through a function F . In other words, Sm = F (S1, S2, S3, ..., Sn). To cancel catastrophic transitions some dependency has to exist also between the generators of Ri and the monitor's generators. The task at this step is to suggest the monitor's state derivations and generators, such that a cancellation of catastrophic transitions can be possible.\n</p><p>3. Find the possible mappings between the available monitor interventions and the warning states sw ∈ Sw such that the catastrophic states are no longer reachable. In the FSM view of the monitor, we need to now find the transition relation such that @σm ∈ Σm, sc ∈ Sc that satisfy F−1(sm) σm−−→m sc. In the Joint system, the critical states are unreachable.\n</p><p>Referring back to the collision avoidance problem, the vehicle's autonomous driving systems contribute an additional actor P to T′. Its states that are relevant to safety are contained in the space of possible states for the system with no monitor Sp ⊂ S, but the generators Σ and transition relations −→ of T are pessimistically unconstrained by those of P .\n</p><p>In a comprehensive collision avoidance scenario, the vehicle's surrounding regions need to be considered longitudinally to avoid collisions from the front and back, laterally to avoid collisions from the sides, as well as possibly under the vehicle to avoid tires running on hazardous objects below. The boundaries for the zones depend on the possibilities for hazards and monitor interventions, and\nmust be chosen such that intervention specifications are implementable. This thesis will next discuss a longitudinal collision avoidance model, and build up to a model for combined longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance.\n</p><p>3.1.1 Longitudinal Collision Avoidance\n</p><p>For the longitudinal case, an occupancy grid is considered in the form shown in Figure 4, consisting of safe, warning and critical regions. The boundaries of the regions, in terms of both shape and distance, are beyond the scope of SMOF, and are treated separately as technical specifications.\n</p><p>In the figure, the critical region isRc, and the two warning regions areRf andRb, which respectively represent the front and back of the vehicle. With this simple model, the possibilities for obstacles to emerge into the critical region from below, or descend from above are not supported.\n</p><p>Figure 4: Occupancy grid for longitudinal model\n</p><p>The occupancy state of each warning region is modeled using a finite state machine, shown in Figure 5. The state begins with the region empty, and can become occupied if an object approaches. After which, the object may either continue to approach, or become relatively stationary. At this point, the status cannot change to empty before the object departs first.\n</p><p>Figure 5: Finite state machine representation of region status\n</p><p>The SMOF tool uses a template NuSMV model that includes a model of the system, and a model of accident causality. The occupancy FSM was implemented as a NuSMV module and instantiated in two variables representing the Rf and Rb regions. The accident model used defines an accident as an approaching state for two consecutive time steps in any region.\n</p><p>The tool identified the seven expected warning states:\n</p><p>• an approach in Rf , with empty, stationary, or departing Rb\n</p><p>• an approach in Rb, with empty, stationary, or departing Rf\n</p><p>• an approach in both Rf and Rb\n</p><p>The next step is to suggest interventions that can be used to synthesize safety strategies. The two obvious interventions for longitudinal collision avoidance would be to brake and to accelerate. The technical specification of interventions, as for physical boundaries of regions and time step, are beyond the scope of the SMOF methodology, and are to be addressed separately. However, the interventions suggested must be implementable for any resulting safety strategies to be viable. Braking is defined, at this stage, as simply braking sufficiently such that if a frontal approach occurs it does not persist in the next time step. The accelerate intervention is defined also in a similar way, assuming suitable technical implementation.\n</p><p>The brake and accelerate interventions are not adequate in the case of approaching states simultaneously in the two regions. As would be expected, the SMOF tool fails to find a safety strategy. To demonstrate the tool's synthesis capability, a third intervention has been added to allow for the possibility of avoiding accidents by transferring control to other systems or the driver. This could be criticized due to the various implementation challenges with such an intervention. Notwithstand-\ning, the transfer control intervention is assumed to be viable, and used simply to demonstrate safety strategy synthesis with SMOF.\n</p><p>The tool identifies four strategies. The expected strategy has been found, as shown below, while the other three strategies involve transferring control also when not approached simultaneously from the front and back.\n</p><p>• brake following a frontal approach\n</p><p>• accelerate following a backward approach\n</p><p>• transfer control following simultaneously both a forward and backward approach\n</p><p>This example demonstrates the SMOF approach and tool, where the safety monitoring rules are produced automatically according to user supplied models. The next section develops a model for combined longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance.\n</p><p>3.1.2 Longitudinal and Lateral Collision Avoidance\n</p><p>In this combined scenario, the lateral motion is accounted for in addition to the longitudinal motion modeled in the previous section, as well as the interaction between the two. This allows the following possibilities not available in the previous case:\n</p><p>• With awareness of the lateral dimension, collisions from the sides may also be avoided, rather than only the front and back.\n</p><p>• The safety distance needed can be lower if collisions can be avoided with steering, or both steering and longitudinal control.\n</p><p>As was previously noted, specification of region boundaries, the time step, as well as the technical implementation of interventions is beyond the scope of the SMOF approach. The occupancy grid considered is shown in Figure 6, with in addition to the Rf and Rb regions, the left and right regions Rl and Rr are included. The possibility for lower safety distance due to steering is not aimed at in this model, as it would require being able to differentiate between the left and right regions within both Rf and Rb (for example, steering left does not avoid obstacles at the front-left direction). This would require additional variables, and result in a larger state space. As was noted previously, state space explosion is a major concern with model checking.\n</p><p>Figure 6: Occupancy grid for combined longitudinal and lateral model\n</p><p>Using the same set of states as before, one way to model the combined longitudinal and lateral motion is to simply enumerate all possible combinations. For the longitudinal model, one region was described using four states. Lateral motion can be described similarly using the same four states. The number of combinations is 16. The number of transitions to set would then be 16 × 16 = 256. This approach was not pursued, although it is the obvious way. Instead, the previous model in Figure 5 was adapted with one instance used for each of the longitudinal and lateral motions within a region. Then, a few constraints were imposed to model the dependencies between lateral and longitudinal states within a region.\n</p><p>Each warning region is described by two FSMs of the form shown in Figure 7, one for the longitudinal and another for the lateral states.\n</p><p>Figure 7: Finite state machine representation of longitudinal/lateral components\n</p><p>Compared to the previous FSM, now all transitions are possible, due to motion from the other direction. To account for the interdependencies between the two FSMs, the following constraints are added (⇐⇒ and =⇒ denote logical equivalence and implication, respectively)\n</p><p>• empty laterally ⇐⇒ empty longitudinally\n</p><p>• longitudinally stationary or departing without previous approach =⇒ lateral approach\n</p><p>• longitudinally approaching and previously departing =⇒ lateral approach (previous object exited and new one entered)\n</p><p>• longitudinally empty and previously stationary or approaching =⇒ previous lateral depart\n</p><p>• laterally stationary or departing without previous approach =⇒ longitudinal approach\n</p><p>• laterally approaching and previously departing =⇒ longitudinal approach\n</p><p>• laterally empty and previously stationary or approaching =⇒ previous longitudinal depart\n</p><p>First the SMOF approach was attempted only with two regions, Rf and Rr. Accidents can be caused either by continuous longitudinal approach from the front, or continuous lateral approach from the right. The tool identified 51 warning states, which comprise of cases with either a frontal longitudinal approach, or a right lateral approach.\n</p><p>Two interventions were then used: braking and left steering. As explained in the previous section, the technical implementation of the interventions is not covered in the SMOF approach. Braking is defined as previously: decelerating sufficiently such that if a frontal approach occurs it does not persist in the next time step. Left steering is defined in a similar way with no reference to implementation. The tool finds the expected strategy:\n</p><p>• brake following a frontal longitudinal approach\n</p><p>• steer left following a right lateral approach\n</p><p>• brake and steer left following a simultaneous frontal longitudinal approach and right lateral approach\n</p><p>This successfully demonstrates the SMOF tool for a more complex application than previously seen in Section 3.1.1. Next, the two missing regions were added, namely the back and left regions, and the accident model was correspondingly extended. The SMOF tool was found unfortunately not feasible even in computing the warning states for the full model.\n</p><p>Although the tool has not been of assistance, this does not preclude using the SMOF architecture. Two additional interventions were added for acceleration and right steering, and a further transfer control intervention was added, following Section 3.1.1. A strategy was proposed manually and checked with NuSMV:\n</p><p>• brake if not longitudinally approached from the back and either approached longitudinally from the front or trapped laterally\n</p><p>• accelerate if not braking, and not longitudinally approached from the front and either approached longitudinally from the back or trapped laterally\n</p><p>• steer left if not laterally approached from the left and either approached laterally from the right or trapped longitudinally\n</p><p>• steer right if not steering left, and not laterally approached from the right and either approached laterally from the left or trapped longitudinally\n</p><p>• transfer control if trapped longitudinally, and trapped laterally\n</p><p>where \"trapped\" refers to when having obstacles in two opposite regions, i.e. front and back for longitudinal, while left and right for lateral trapping. In order to avoid conflicts when two opposing interventions are possible, preference is given to braking and left steering.\n</p><p>In the preceding sections, the SMOF tool has been demonstrated for the simple scenario of longitudinal collision avoidance, and for a more complex scenario with frontal and rightwards collision avoidance incorporating two dimensional motion. Although the tool suffered from the state space problem when applied to an even more complex model, a solution could be model checked successfully, allowing for the use of SMOF safety strategies. The main components in the SMOF approach\nis the partitioning of the state space to identify warning states, and the use of safety strategies, that when needed enact interventions to prevent transitions to critical states. These were achieved in all the cases considered in the previous sections. The following section examines the technical implementation aspects that need to be addressed.\n</p><h4><p>3.2 Safety Distance Using Time-Varying Acceleration Models\n</p></h4><p>Given predicted relative acceleration â(t) between the ego vehicle and the object (e.g. a leading/trailing vehicle), and initial relative speed v0, the task is to obtain the initial separation x0 that avoids a trajectory reaching 0 distance, if this is possible for â(t) and v0. The main result is derived in Appendix A, and stated as: ∫ 0\n</p><p>x0\n</p><p>â(t)dx = −1 2 v20 (1)\n</p><p>Equation 1 gives a relation between initial velocity and required separation for time-varying acceleration. An analytic solution requires an expression for the relative acceleration a(t) in terms of x, which is not available. Alternatively, a solution can be found numerically as will be shown in the next section. For the constant acceleration case the equation reduces to x0 =\n</p><p>v20\n</p><p>2ac\n</p><p>(2)\n</p><p>where ac is the constant acceleration.\n</p><p>To demonstrate a numerical approach to finding the needed separation distance in terms of initial relative speed, consider that the object moves towards the ego vehicle according to predicted acceleration curve ai(t), which is initially positive but decreases as the other object reacts to the situation, and consider that the ego vehicle is capable of acceleration profile as(t) in collision avoidance. For this example, assume that the two functions are of the form\n</p><p>ai(t) = R\n</p><p>(\n</p><p>2\n</p><p>1 − tanh(t)\n</p><p>)\n</p><p>as(t) = −ksR tanh(αs t).\n</p><p>R is the expected possible acceleration range in m/s2. The hyperbolic tangent has been used simply due to its shape containing transient and steady-state regions. A value of 4.3403 corresponds to 0-100km/hour in 6.4 seconds. ks is a scale factor representing the amount by which the magnitude of the ego vehicle's reaction is larger than the object's reaction, and αs represents the relative quickness in responding to the situation.\n</p><p>Let us use: R = 0.5, ks = 1.5, αs = 0.5 as example. The resulting functions are shown in Figure 8, with also the relative acceleration â(t) = ai(t) + as(t) plotted.\n</p><p>Figure 8: Time varying accelerations of the two objects\n</p><p>These simple models contain two phases: a transient response and a steady-state response. This assumes that the steady-state (of acceleration) continues indefinitely, implying that no reduction in deceleration occurs, and that collision avoidance efforts can persist as long as needed. However, in practice the relative acceleration may eventually go to zero, as would be the case with braking leading to a stopped vehicle.\n</p><p>The relative distance trajectory x(t) is found by integrating the acceleration twice:\n</p><p>d2x(t) dt2 = dv(t) dt\n</p><p>= â(t)\n</p><p>v(t) =\n</p><p>∫ t â(τ)dτ + v0\n</p><p>x(t) =\n</p><p>∫ t\n</p><p>0 ∫ γ\n</p><p>0 0\n</p><p>â(τ)dτdγ + v0t+ x0.\n</p><p>where v0 is the initial approach (relative) speed. For any v0, we can find the least separation (least negative x0) that ensures x(t) > 0, ∀t > 0. By iterating over different approach speeds we can obtain a relation between v0 and x0.\n</p><p>A speed of 40km/hour corresponds to 11.12m/s. Let us consider approach speeds in the range [0.1,11.12]. Figure 9 shows the least separation solutions for the different initial speeds v0. Notice that trajectories are always non positive for all the curves. Arriving at zero separation indicates that the initial separation is minimal. Due to the prolonged steady-state acceleration seen in Figure 8, the trajectory reverses after reaching zero separation (objects just touch then separate). The trajectory after zero separation is not of relevance for collision avoidance, and can be ignored.\n</p><p>Figure 9: Solution trajectories for different initial speeds v0\n</p><p>Finally a relation between v0 and x0 can be obtained, as shown in Figure 10.\n</p><p>Figure 10: v0 to x0 relation\n</p><p>Let us now consider the constant acceleration case to find how the required initial separation distance compares to the result in Figure 10. It is not apparent how one should select a value of ac in Equation 2. As example, consider the steady-state, average, median, and 25th percentile accelerations during the initial 10 seconds. Figure 11 shows the results for these constant estimates obtained by invoking Equation 2, together with the time-varying acceleration result.\n</p><p>Figure 11: v0 to x0 relation for constant acceleration\n</p><p>Optimistic separation distances were found for all the constant acceleration cases. The steady-state (minimum) acceleration yielded the most optimistic separation, as would be expected. The median is the acceleration at 5s in Figure 8, which is very close to the steady state. The 25th percentile is 2.5s in the figure. The average is the most conservative but still gives optimistic separation distance. These results indicate the significance of the initial period where the approach speed is high but little deceleration is taking place.\n</p><p>In the approach presented in this section, collisions can be avoided if the separation is greater than the obtained safety distance value. This gives the distance boundary needed in the SMOF approach, for interventions to be viable. The calculation uses relative motion in one direction. The boundary can be constructed along any direction of interest provided the following are available along that direction:\n</p><p>• Current speed of approach between ego vehicle and object\n</p><p>• Knowledge of ego vehicle's acceleration capability\n</p><p>• Expectation for future acceleration of the object\n</p><p>Once the object is within this physical boundary, interventions can be triggered according to the safety strategies used.\n</p><p>Next in this thesis, a case study is presented which employs simulation to test and demonstrate SMOF safety monitoring for collision avoidance. The main motivation in this work is safety assurance for learning systems. The study will deploy a vision-based autonomous driving function, along with safety monitoring using the approach discussed thus far.\n</p><h3><p>4 Case Study: Safety Monitoring for Vision-Based Vehicle Control\n</p></h3><p>This section presents an implementation of safety monitoring and vehicle control toolchains within a simulation environment. A deep learning system will be used to drive a simulated vehicle, and experiments will be performed to investigate safety with malfunctioning vehicle control.\n</p><p>Previous sections have discussed the safety concerns with learning systems in autonomous driving, and the difficulty of verifying their safety properties. Instead, an architectural safety monitoring approach is pursued in this thesis. Section 3.1 applied the SMOF safety monitoring approach to collision avoidance, and Section 3.2 discussed an approach for obtaining the distance boundary needed for interventions to be viable. This section studies a case where a learning system controls the vehicle, and develops a framework for supporting safety investigations. The scenario consists of a vision-based speed control system for longitudinal motion, along with a collision avoidance safety system to mitigate risks due to faults in the learning system.\n</p><p>Driving simulators are of help in this study, both for generating synthetic data, and for testing the effectiveness of safety systems. The experimental approach depends greatly on the capabilities offered by the driving simulator, and computational resources available. This topic is addressed next, after which the control toolchain and the experiments are presented.\n</p><h4><p>4.1 Driving Simulation\n</p></h4><p>The motivation for using driving simulators in this study is that they can offer the possibility to experiment with driving scenarios that are difficult, and costly, to create in a real environment. For example, factors that make real-world experiments prohibitive are: access to vehicles and needed hardware, ensuring tests are safe, needing to perform system identification or measure relevant parameters, setting up prototype autonomous driving systems, the time to set up and conduct experiments, and also the difficulty of setting up controlled experiments when relevant variables cannot be controlled. With driving simulators, it is possible to work at a higher level of abstraction focusing more closely on the learning and safety systems at the functional level. The driving environment can be interfaced with system models as part of a software-in-the-loop or model-in-the-loop setup, which helps in evaluating functional safety.\n</p><p>Specifically for this vision-based speed control study, the elements needed in a driving simulator are the following.\n</p><p>• off-line data export The quantities that are relevant to training need to be available for off-line use. These include: image frames, distance traveled by ego vehicle, distances to other vehicles of interest, acceleration and brake pedal positions, simulation time, as well as any other interesting information for training.\n</p><p>• closed loop control To pursue control in a dynamic virtual world environment, there needs to be a possibility for using the above quantities in a closed loop setup where data is processed and control is sent to the vehicle during simulation. This can require synchronization between several simulation software components and user models.\n</p><p>• adequate virtual world A basic level of scientific accuracy is needed in the simulation environment. This includes the physics of the vehicles within the environment, and also the visual appearance of virtual world.\n</p><p>Three virtual driving simulators have been tried to assess their potential to support vision-based control studies: IPG CarMaker, TESIS DYNA4, and TASS PreScan. These simulators are discussed in the following subsections.\n</p><p>4.1.1 IPG CarMaker\n</p><p>CarMaker is a virtual testing platform for passenger cars and light-duty vehicles. The simulator can be interfaced with the MATLAB/Simulink environment using CarMaker's provided templates that include S-function blocks. The user's control strategies can be implemented either by manipulating Simulink signals or by creating custom modules. CarMaker can be run either stand-alone, or in cosimulation with Simulink.\n</p><p>CarMaker offers possibilities for offline data export. After simulations, image frames can be obtained from the animation tool either by exporting video frames, or by exporting a video. However, timestamps are not available if the image frames are exported directly. The data plotting tool, IPG-Control, can be used for exporting simulation variables into a csv file. To capture data, IPGControl needs to be configured before simulations.\n</p><p>Except for a camera feed, all our needed quantities can be used directly in a closed loop setup within Simulink. IPG offers the Video Data Stream (VDS) extension package which allows sending video out of the animation tool via TCP, and includes some additional features for adding camera noise, motion blur, etc. This feature was not included in my initial trail, and had to be requested specifically. Using the additional visual features greatly reduces simulation and movie export speeds. Once a camera is configured within CarMaker, the animation tool, which is a separate program, sends out the video stream via TCP. After making several attempts to receive the video in Simulink using different approaches, at best the received images contained some distortions/artifacts, and the animation tool did not synchronize successfully with Simulink.\n</p><p>As for other factors, CarMaker meets the needs adequately with regards to scientific accuracy of the simulations and visual appearance of the virtual world.\n</p><p>4.1.2 TESIS DYNAware DYNA4\n</p><p>DYNA4 is simulation framework aimed at supporting vehicle development processes, and runs within Simulink, allowing for signals to be accessed and manipulated. Users can also configure and add new Simulink modules from within DYNA4.\n</p><p>To export data for offline use, one can select the needed quantities before the simulation, and then a mat file with needed variables is produced after its completion. DYNA4 stores the data needed to recreate the animation after simulations. Video can then be played back or exported, for any completed simulation.\n</p><p>Data signals are available for closed loop control, however, in the commercially available DYNA4 product camera pixels are not accessible in Simulink. TESIS kindly allowed me the opportunity to test a development version which includes this functionality. To obtain the camera feed for closed loop control, the camera is configured within DYNA4, and a receiver block is added to the corresponding Simulink model of the simulation project. A blocking communication is setup between the animation tool and Simulink, allowing for pixel data be accessed simply.\n</p><p>DYNA4 offers a visually appealing animation which can support our vision-based control investigation, as well as an adequately accurate virtual world.\n</p><p>4.1.3 TASS PreScan\n</p><p>Prescan offers a simulation framework for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Intelligent Vehicle (IV) systems, targeted more for the simulation of sensors and the virtual environment, rather that vehicle dynamics. Simulink is also used as a simulation engine. After the scenario is configured in a GUI tool, a Simulink model is generated. ADAS functions can be implemented simply by modifying the generated models. Also, a wide variety of demos are provided featuring different ADAS functions, allowing for users to substitute their own algorithms. Sensor technologies such as radar, laser, camera, ultrasonic, GPS and C2C/C2I communications, are supported. A physics-based camera model is also available, which accounts for a complete pipeline from light sources to optics and final image.\n</p><p>One notable aspect with PreScan is its strong integration with MATLAB and Simulink, allowing for a lot of possibilities for accessing signals and controlling various elements of the virtual world, e.g. all simulation vehicles, pedestrians, sensors, and even lightposts. RGB pixels are also available conveniently in Simulink, facilitating camera-based ADAS function development. Furthermore, simulation runs can be automated with MATLAB scripts, which allows for performing tests with changed parameters and collecting results for processing, or exporting the data. Video can also be exported in different formates using a GUI visualization tool.\n</p><p>Simple vehicle dynamics models are available in PreScan, which can be freely modified in Simulink. For more complex dynamics, PreScan allows for integration with other tools, such as CarSim and veDYNA.\n</p><h4><p>4.2 Vision to Speed Control\n</p></h4><p>Since the focus of this work is on learning systems in safety critical automotive applications, an example system is considered that controls the speed of the ego vehicle using camera images of the road. This study is delimited to longitudinal speed control, although a more comprehensive model was developed in Section 3.1.2.\n</p><p>The scenario consists of one leading vehicle fixed at some distance ahead of the ego vehicle. The task of the learning system is to detect the leading vehicle, and feed this information to a controller which then controls the gas and brake pedal positions. In such a setup, the output of the learning system can be readily compared to ground-truth for analysis.\n</p><p>A deep neural network is used to detect the leading vehicle and provide bounding box information to be used for speed control. Since the distance to the leading vehicle is directly related to the bounding box size, a simple power-law function can be used to obtain a control signal, which then determines the gas and brake pedal positions.\n</p><p>Using such a setup where the learning system outputs intermediate bounding box information has some benefits:\n</p><p>• This corresponds to a logical subproblem to the main speed control problem. If an end-to-end approach were used, the learning system would instead map pixel data to gas/brake pedal control. As discussed in Section 2.1, logical subsystems of end-to-end systems cannot be inspected, which allows a possibility for faults to be masked.\n</p><p>• The ground truth is simple to determine, and depends only on images. In fact, the detector's performance can be assessed intuitively by viewing the resulting image sequence. For an end-to-end system, in contrast, the ground truth may depend on other factors such as the current speed and acceleration.\n</p><p>• Since the scenario involves only one leading vehicle, the bounding box is sufficient information for a control strategy.\n</p><p>• Many pretrained object detectors are available, allowing for the possibility of experimenting with existing state of the art networks.\n</p><p>The function of the learning system in this study is to identify the leading vehicle in camera images containing the road, environment, scenery and other traffic objects. For such a problem, object localization as well as classification are needed. One interesting approach is to use a region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN), which includes a region proposal network and an object classification network. A recent advancement in using this architecture is the Faster R-CNN [23, 24], where the classification network shares full-image convolutional features with the region proposal network, which enables nearly cost-free region proposals. The experiments presented in the following section employ a Faster R-CNN trained for localizing and classifying the leading vehicle.\n</p><h4><p>4.3 Experiments\n</p></h4><p>The experimental setup considered consists of an empty stretch of road with one fixed vehicle located some distance ahead of the ego vehicle. A camera is placed behind the front windshield of the ego vehicle, and a Faster R-CNN system processes the images in order to control the speed. This simple experimental setup allows for testing only frontal collision avoidance. Extensions could be made in order to study more comprehensive scenarios, especially where the safety strategies are complex. However, this was not attempted in this experiment. More complex monitoring scenarios would help to test safety monitors, but contribute little to a safety investigation of the fundamental concerns with learning systems.\n</p><p>The strategy computed for the SMOF safety monitor in the longitudinal case (see Section 3.1.1) was to trigger a braking intervention when the warning region is in an approach state. This occurs as soon as when the distance to the leading vehicle becomes less than the safe distance. A key point is that the safety monitor can trigger interventions, rather than passively monitor, or only block actions, and technical specifications of interventions and region boundaries allow for guaranteeing collision avoidance if the specifications hold. The monitor calculates the safe distance dynamically based on the ego vehicle's current speed and the relative acceleration, using the approach presented in Section 3.2. Since in this simplified setup the leading vehicle is stationary, only the ego vehicle's deceleration curve is needed in the calculation.\n</p><p>Figure 12 shows a block diagram of the control setup used for experiments. Camera images are used to control the speed of the ego vehicle, with a safety monitor installed to intervene when a warning state is reached. Ground truth information is used for safety monitoring, as this avoids introducing additional points of failure extraneous to the learning system under study.\n</p><p>Figure 12: Control loop with safety monitoring\n</p><p>The goals for experiments are twofold: firstly to simulate the safety monitoring and vision-based control toolchains and demonstrate collision avoidance in cases of hazardous speed control; and secondly to discuss an example trustworthiness indicator for the learning system, which can help warn in advance before severe safety interventions are needed. This is related to the Safe Fail strategy mentioned in Section 2, in which the system does not attempt to offer an output in case of low confidence, or closeness to the decision boundary, and the operator makes the decision instead. However, in the speed control context, it is not possible to expect for the driver to immediately take over. The trustworthiness indication approach in this thesis allows for the driver to be warned regarding the learning system in a low confidence scenario.\n</p><p>4.3.1 Design of Experiments\n</p><p>The Neural Network Toolbox in MATLAB 2017a offers an implementation of the Faster R-CNN deep learning system, including a class object and a function to train the detector. Although code from the Faster R-CNN authors is publicly available [23, 24], The implementation in the toolbox was opted for, due to ease of use and possibly quicker development time. Flexibility in regard to tweaking and tailoring algorithms for better performance is not a primary goal for this project.\n</p><p>The virtual world contains a straight stretch of road with some trees along the sides, and one\nvehicle fixed 300m ahead of the ego vehicle. The only variable that affects the camera images is the ego vehicle's position along the road. Therefore, by simply passing the camera along the road it is possible to capture images at any needed distance resolution.\n</p><p>This scenario avoids needing to perform image processing online. Image processing and driving simulation are computationally expensive tasks. At the time of conducting the work for this thesis, an adequate computational setup was not yet available, and the available GPU was not supported by MATLAB. This greatly limits the achievable frame rate as the detector is run on CPU instead. For 500x375 images, the detector computes at around 0.15 fps on the available machine, rather than 5 fps in the Faster R-CNN author's papers. For a closed loop setup, the detector would need to run in Simulink as an extrinsic function, since code generation for the Faster R-CNN object detector class is not supported in Simulink. The 0.15 fps would therefore not be improved. In addition, driving simulators are also computational expensive which further limits the speed. A closed-loop setup with such computational limitations would hinder the prototyping and evaluation of systems.\n</p><p>On the other hand, if a more complex scenario with moving objects were used, the camera images would depend on several variables that would be difficult to control, necessitating a closed-loop setup. As online image processing is not pursued, any of the previously mentioned virtual vehicle simulators could be used: IPG CarMaker, TESIS DYNA4, and TASS PreScan. CarMaker was selected primarily because it was made available before the other two. PreScan, along with a suitable computer setup for simulation was available only after completing the work for this thesis. The test vehicle chosen is the demo Tesla S model example provided in CarMaker, which uses an electrical powertrain, and a camera was added behind the front windshield.\n</p><p>The ego vehicle was passed along the road at low speed and the frontal camera's video stream was exported, and then processed to produce images at 0.1m resolution. These images are used for training and testing, as well as to precompute detections at 0.1m intervals along the road for access during simulations. The labeling process requires manually drawing the bounding box of the leading vehicle in each image. This process was automated with the help of the MATLAB Ground Truth Labeler app, which can interpolate between manually made labels at key frames.\n</p><p>Due to computational limitations, small 128x228 images were used. Training of a Faster R-CNN is a four step process. In the first step, the region proposal network (RPN) is trained. In the second, a separate detection network is trained using the proposals from step 1 RPN. In the third step, the detector is used to initialize the RPN, but only the layers unique to the RPN are trained. Finally in the fourth step, the layers unique to the detector are trained. One problem that occurred frequently in my training attempts is that no positive or negative samples may be found in the fourth step, when the proposals from the third step are used. At far distances from the leading vehicle, less pixels are used to represent the vehicle, which presents a challenge in training. The training process could complete only if far distances are excluded.\n</p><p>The leading vehicle is 300m ahead along the road. Detectors for two different distance ranges were investigated:\n</p><p>1. A detector was trained for the distance ranges 250-270m and 280-295m, using 351 training images.\n</p><p>2. A detector was trained for the distance range 270-295m, using 251 training images.\n</p><p>4.3.2 Safety Monitoring\n</p><p>For calculating the safety distance dynamically at run time, the deceleration curve of the ego vehicle, and the expected acceleration curve of the leading vehicle are needed. Modeling the behavior of\nthe leading vehicle for collision avoidance scenarios is an interesting topic for dedicated research. Discussed in [22] is the concept of decision functions, in which dynamic models of the two vehicles and the expectation of their future actions are used as the basis for decisions. The scenario in this simple study uses a stationary leading vehicle, and the safety monitor is designed based on this operating condition. Also, the braking curve can vary with different road conditions. In this study, the effect of different road conditions is not investigated, and could be also a topic for further work.\n</p><p>To determine the braking curve of the Tesla demo vehicle model, braking tests were performed on the same road to be used in the experiments. Figure 13 shows the braking behavior for different starting speeds until the vehicle is stopped. It takes approximately 1.5 seconds to reach maximum deceleration, which continues until the vehicle is almost stopped. As shown in the figure, this initial phase is the same regardless of the starting speed. Inspecting the distance traveled in the final phase when going back to zero acceleration shows that it is only a few centimeters (2-4 cm). For safety monitoring, only the initial phase and the maximum deceleration phase will be used in safety distance calculation.\n</p><p>Figure 13: Braking deceleration for CarMaker test vehicle\n</p><p>4.3.3 Control System\n</p><p>The speed of the ego vehicle is controlled via the gas and brake pedal position signals in the CarMaker Simulink model. The Faster R-CNN system outputs bounding boxes (this locates the object within the image) and corresponding scores of detected objects classified as the leading vehicle. The area of the highest scoring bounding box is used as an indirect indicator of the leading vehicle's distance. This applies since the vehicles are configured to be in the same lane. The control law then used to obtain an intermediate signal is in the following form\n</p><p>u = Aα\n</p><p>where A is the bounding box area (width × height pixels) divided by the image area, and α is a tunable parameter that affect the cautiousness of the resulting control. The resulting signal u takes values from the 0-1 range. The gas and brake pedal positions can be derived from u according to:\n</p><p>brake =\n</p><p>{\n</p><p>2 (u− 0.5) u > 0.5\n</p><p>0 u ≤ 0.5\n</p><p>gas =\n</p><p>{\n</p><p>−2 (u− 0.5) u &lt; 0.5\n</p><p>0 u ≥ 0.5\n</p><p>which results in braking with no gas when u is larger than 0.5, and gas with no brakes otherwise. Both gas and brake pedals are not engaged when u = 0.5.\n</p><p>This control strategy is implemented in Simulink as shown in Figure 14, with also a moving average included to smooth out u. This is helpful especially for malfunctioning detector behavior with momentary object appearance or disappearance. The window size used is 200 samples. The simulation is configured for variable step size in the CarMaker Simulink interface, but inspection shows that 200 samples correspond to about 0.2 seconds of simulation time.\n</p><p>Figure 14: Simulink control system for brake and gas pedal\n</p><p>Simulations were performed using ground truth bounding box information in order to calibrate the α parameter, and a suitable value found was 0.1. Figure 15 shows the resulting vehicle speed and the corresponding control signals. The vehicle was initialized at 100km/hour (ca. 27.8m/s). Figure 16 shows the distance trajectory, with the accident distance marked.\n</p><p>Figure 15: Speed control for α = 0.1, and ground truth detections.\n</p><p>Figure 16: Distance curve for α = 0.1, and ground truth detections.\n</p><p>4.3.4 Evaluation Metrics\n</p><p>Two detectors for different distance ranges will be tested. The training difficulties were previously noted with regard to far distances, and training had to be restricted to closer distances for it to succeed. The first detector was trained for 250-270 and 280-295m, using 351 training images. Training did not yield good performance even within this training set, but this presents an interesting case for safety studies, as will be discussed. The second detector was trained for the easier 270-295m, using 251 training images. Much better performance could be achieved for this case within the training range, but this limited range helps to illustrate how a learning system can perform well for some data that was represented in the training, but cause hazardous behavior with unseen data.\n</p><p>The metric we will use for evaluating the performance of the learning system is the Intersection over Union (IoU) which is defined as IoU(A,B) =\n</p><p>area(A ∩B) area(A ∪B)\n</p><p>where A and B are the ground truth and detector bounding boxes. When multiple detections are produced by the detector, the highest scoring detection is used. The IoU does not distinguish between\nfalse positives and false negatives, but is a common metric for evaluating detectors and is sufficient given that false positives would trigger unwarranted braking.\n</p><p>Another measure that is of interest in this research is related to the similarity/dissimilarity of incoming camera images with the training images. Since the network is trained entirely using synthetic data from CarMaker, the influence of the training data can be controlled and accounted for. In addition, the random seed for the training process was fixed to insure reproducibility of the training results.\n</p><p>An example measure which utilizes SURF [25] features is used in these experiments. The SURF features of the highest scoring interest point in images are computed and used as descriptors. The disparity measure used in the experiments computes the Euclidean distance between the computed features of the runtime images to the nearest neighbor in the training set. SURF was chosen due to its speed advantages and scale invariance property. Other methods are not investigated in this study, but could be a topic for further research.\n</p><p>4.3.5 First Detector\n</p><p>This detector was trained with 351 128x228 images for 250-270, and 280-295m distances. As previously mentioned, the less pixels used to represent the vehicle, the more difficult is the learning task. Attempts at training with the full 0-300m distance range have failed, and hence training was focused on closer distances where the leading vehicle is larger in the image. This detector was trained for 25 epochs.\n</p><p>Figure 17 shows the IoU and disparity for the first detector, with the two distance ranges shaded. The measurements were filtered using a moving average of the same length as the moving average used for u, and 1 standard deviation curves are also plotted. The disparity is zero within the training intervals, as the incoming data was represented in the training set. On the other hand, distances away from the training intervals yielded high disparity, which decreases closer to the intervals. Ideally, the disparity measure should vary smoothly with distance, but this was seen not to be the case with using SURF features of a single interest point. Nonetheless, the metric helps to demonstrate that a disparity measure can be used to judge how well new data was represented in training. The detections were completely erroneous in the first trained interval, 250-270, as indicated by the IoU, while some detection capability is seen in the second trained interval 280-295.\n</p><p>Figure 17: IoU and disparity mean and ± 1 standard deviation curves for the poor performing first detector. Notice low disparity close to and between training ranges.\n</p><p>Figure 18 shows the trajectory of the ego vehicle along the road. An intervention was triggered, which successfully brought the vehicle to a halt before colliding with the leading vehicle.\n</p><p>Figure 18: Distance trajectory along the road for the first detector, with braking intervention triggered\n</p><p>The speed control is shown in Figure 19, with the vehicle initialized at the start of the road with 0km/hour. A false positives period (vehicle detected as at close distance when it is actually farther away) caused braking starting at around 4 seconds. This is followed by a period where the detector is making some detections which are not accurate, as indicated by IoU in Figure 17. Afterwards, false negatives (vehicle detected as far away when it is actually near) caused an approach with high speed, which necessitates an intervention well before the trained intervals are encountered. In fact, the controller requested braking only towards the end of simulation when a good IoU is obtained.\n</p><p>Figure 19: Speed control for the first detector. Dashed lines indicate overridden signal. False +ives indicate detecting a very near vehicle when it is in fact farther away, while false -ives indicate that the vehicle is detected as far away when it is in fact near.\n</p><p>4.3.6 Second Detector\n</p><p>In light of the poor performance of the first detector, especially in its first trained distance range, a second attempt was made to train another detector with closer distances, making the learning task less difficult. The distance range was limited to 270-295m, and a detector was trained for 25 epochs with 251 training images.\n</p><p>Training indicated some success in learning within the trained distances. Two experiments are performed to illustrate both non-malfunctioning behavior where safety interventions are not required, and malfunctioning behavior that triggers the monitor interventions. In a low speed experiment, the needed safety distance does not exceed the trained range, which allows the controller an opportunity to operate within the learning system's trained distance range. Another experiment with higher approach speed was then performed, and a monitor intervention was necessary, since the learning system malfunctioned outside its trained distance range.\n</p><p>Low speed experiment\n</p><p>For this experiment, the setup is initialized such that the learning system is allowed an opportunity\nto function within its trained distance range. Approaching at 70km/h would trigger an intervention at the start of the trained distance range, precluding the possibility of observing the controller's performance. The detector was seen to suffer from a false positives problem that brings the vehicle to a halt prematurely if initialized at the start of the road. To address these problems, the vehicle was initialized at 250m along the road with 35km/h.\n</p><p>Figure 20 shows the IoU and disparity for the second detector. The measurements were filtered as before with detector 1 with the same moving average, and ±1 standard deviation curves are plotted. As indicated by the IoU, much better performance is attained within the learned distance range. The disparity is zero within the training intervals, as before, and is higher away from the trained data. The trend in disparity tends to be inversely related to the IoU performance measure.\n</p><p>Figure 20: IoU and disparity mean and ± 1 standard deviation curves for the second detector low speed experiment.\n</p><p>Figure 21 shows the trajectory of the ego vehicle along the road. An intervention was not required, as the controller successfully brought the vehicle to a halt before colliding with the obstacle.\n</p><p>Figure 21: Distance trajectory along the road for the second detector low speed experiment, with braking intervention not triggered\n</p><p>Figure 22 shows the speed control of the vehicle, initialized at the start of the road with 35km/hour. Light braking was requested initially in an untrained distance before 1.5s. Notice that this coincides with the IoU peak in Figure 20. Afterwards, braking was revoked and the gas pedal was increased briefly. Breaking is triggered again after the trained distance range is reached, stopping the vehicle before a collision.\n</p><p>Figure 22: Speed control for the second detector low speed experiment.\n</p><p>High speed experiment\n</p><p>In the high speed experiment with the second detector, the vehicle is instead initialized at 150m along the road, with 120km/h. At this speed, the needed safety distance is beyond the learning system's trained range. If the control fails to adequately brake prior to reaching the trained range, then a safety intervention would be needed.\n</p><p>Figure 23 shows the filtered IoU and disparity curves in this experiment. The same trend is observed as previously in the other experiments, where the IoU performance tends to be inversely related to the run-time calculated disparity.\n</p><p>Figure 23: IoU and disparity mean and ±1 standard deviation curves for the second detector high speed experiment.\n</p><p>Figure 24 shows the trajectory of the ego vehicle along the road. As for the previous experiment with the first detector seen in Section 4.3.5, an intervention was triggered, which successfully stopped the vehicle and avoided the collision.\n</p><p>Figure 24: Distance trajectory along the road for the second detector high speed experiment, with braking intervention triggered\n</p><p>Figure 25 shows the speed control of the vehicle. Due to false positives (vehicle detected as at close distance when it is actually farther away), strong braking was activated before 1s. During this period zero IoU coupled with disparity peaks are observed in Figure 23. Shortly afterwards, false negatives (vehicle detected as far away when it is actually near) are obtained, which cause unsafe acceleration requiring an intervention. The controller continues to request acceleration until just before 4s where we have previously observed diminishing disparity. However, unlike for the low speed experiment, the controller requested braking too late and was already overridden by the safety monitor.\n</p><p>Figure 25: Speed control for the second detector high speed experiment.\n</p><h4><p>4.4 Findings\n</p></h4><p>In the experiments, the SMOF architecture has been used along with dynamic safety distances. The braking intervention was triggered at the right moments to prevent an accident, which resulted in the ego vehicle stopping only a few meters from collision. In addition, an example indicator for the learning system's trustworthiness has been demonstrated.\n</p><p>The disparity measure in the experiments tended to be inversely related to the learning system's performance, which is expected as performance should be better with data similar to the training set. This also suggests a potential for runtime trustworthiness indication using a disparity approach. Further research could investigate the development of better indicators and the desirable properties they should possess. For example, the disparity indicator used the features of only the highest scoring SURF interest point. In theory, SURF interest points are scale invariant and should not greatly fluctuate as the ego vehicle approaches the other vehicle. However, some fluctuations were observed in the experiments. Brief inspections showed that, for some distances, the highest scoring interest point can change abruptly for minor variation in scale. It could help to investigate combining several interest points, but this would increase the computational demand. Also, SURF operates on gray-scale images. This overlooks possibly essential color information that can affect the performance of the learning system. Other approaches can be tested that incorporate spatial as well as color features\nof images.\n</p><p>of images.\n</p><p>The motivation behind the disparity measure is to obtain a reliable trustworthiness metric that can be computed at run time for incoming data in order to indicate the performance of the learning system. The best ways to utilize this trustworthiness indication could also be a topic for further research. Using it within a safety monitor would yield a more complex monitor, and present challenges with verification or certification. However, such trustworthiness metric can be of help in alerting the driver before a safety monitor intervention is required. Safety interventions can be unpleasant for the driver, as is the case with the full force braking used in the experiments.\n</p><h3><p>5 Discussion\n</p></h3><p>This section discusses and summarizes the thesis, and points to possible directions for further work.\n</p><p>The safety concerns with learning systems were discussed in Section 2. Several concerns emerge from the loss functions and the training data used for developing learning systems. When using quantities such as average prediction error, loss functions may not account for the human cost that is relevant for safety. The training samples may not correctly reflect the scenario that was aimed for, and may inadequately represent rare cases that are highly relevant for safety. Learning systems were discussed for autonomous driving, with particular focus on end-to-end systems. The end-to-end paradigm, discussed in Section 2.1 is an extremely capable approach where complex learning problems are solved implicitly by the systems, without the need to identify and address the logical subproblems. From a safety viewpoint, this compounds the challenges associated with obtaining adequate training data, due to possible fault masking effects. Following a discussion of some relevant sections of the ISO 26262, a promising approach was indicated for meeting safety goals, which involve introducing separate architectural elements that are more amenable to meeting stringent safety requirements, while the learning systems themselves can be exempt from needing to comply with the standard. It was discussed also that verifying properties of learning systems at the technical/mathematical level may not be of help in autonomous driving applications, as that would involve specifying properties of input pixel values and output quantities. Instead, a safety monitoring approach was motivated.\n</p><p>Safety monitoring was discussed in Section 2.3. Formal methods and model checking are useful tools in the design of safety monitors. However, important to consider is the state space explosion problem that can limit the scalability of model checkers. The SMOF safety monitoring approach was found particularly interesting, due to the possibility for monitors that implement interventions, rather than only inhibitions, and the possibility of automatically generating safety strategies. This approach has been applied to a longitudinal collision avoidance scenario, and also a scenario targeting combined longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance. Technical implementation aspects of interventions were also discussed, and an approach was presented for calculating region boundaries using time-varying acceleration models.\n</p><p>A case study was presented in Section 4, involving the use of a learning system to control the vehicle's speed using camera pixel data. The use of simulations for supporting this study was discussed, with important considerations being functionalities for off-line data export, closed loop control, and an adequate virtual world accuracy. Three simulation tools were tried: IPG CarMaker, TESIS DY-NAware, and TASS PreScan. CarMaker was not found to support a vision-based closed loop control setup, but was nonetheless used due to its earlier availability, and challenges with computational resources and time that anyway preclude online closed loop control. A simple scenario was pursued, for which offline processing helps in avoiding the online processing needed in a closed loop setup. Experiments were built within a simulation environment for frontal collision avoidance, including safety monitoring and control toolchains. The SMOF architecture was used, and interventions were triggered following dangerous malfunctioning behavior in the learning system. Finally, also an indicator was presented for the trustworthiness of the learning system during operation.\n</p><p>Further work could investigate simulations with more complex safety monitoring scenarios, beyond the frontal collision avoidance tested in this thesis. In implementing safety interventions with the approach presented in this thesis, an essential information is the expected future trajectory of the object. This was not studied, and the object was simply assumed to be stationary in the experiments.\n</p><p>This topic can be investigated in a further work. If the solution is probabilistic, that would present an interesting concern with regard to determinism in safety monitoring. Finally, a simple example was offered in this thesis to illustrate trustworthiness indication, and little effort was aimed at developing a good performing metric. This topic could be further investigated, including the application of such indicator within safety systems. It is important in particular that computation is feasible online.\n</p><h3><p>References\n</p></h3><p>[1] \"Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems,\" Standard SAE J3016, Society of Automotive Engineers, 2016.\n</p><p>[2] P.

Applikationsområden inkluderar mönsterigenkänning, datorseende, tal‐ och språkförståelse. När utvecklingen inom bilindustrin går mot en ökad grad av automatisering, blir problemen som måste lösas alltmer komplexa, vilket har lett till ett ökat användande av metoder från maskininlärning och deep learning. Med detta tillvägagångssätt lär sig systemet lösningen till ett problem implicit från träningsdata och man kan inte direkt utvärdera lösningens korrekthet. Detta innebär problem när systemet i fråga är del av en säkerhetskritisk funktion, vilket är fallet för självkörande fordon. Detta examensarbete behandlar säkerhetsaspekter relaterade till maskininlärningssystem i autonoma fordon och applicerar en safety monitoring‐metodik på en kollisionsundvikningsfunktion. Simuleringar utförs, med ett deep learning‐system som del av systemet för perception, som ger underlag för styrningen av fordonet, samt en safety monitor för kollisionsundvikning. De relaterade operationella situationerna och säkerhetsvillkoren studeras för en autonom körnings‐funktion, där potentiella fel i det lärande systemet introduceras och utvärderas. Vidare introduceras ett förslag på ett mått på trovärdighet hos det lärande systemet under drift.\n\nii\n\niii\n\nMaster of Science Thesis MMK 2017:149 MES 015\n\nSafety of Machine Learning Systems in Autonomous Driving\n\nFadi Al-Khoury\n\nApproved\n\nExaminer\n\nMartin Törngren\n\nSupervisor\n\nDe-Jiu Chen\n\nCommissioner\n\nContact person\n\nAbstract\n\nMachine Learning, and in particular Deep Learning, are extremely capable tools for solving problems which are difficult, or intractable to tackle analytically. Application areas include pattern recognition, computer vision, speech and natural language processing. With the automotive industry aiming for increasing amount of automation in driving, the problems to solve become increasingly complex, which appeals to the use of supervised learning methods from Machine Learning and Deep Learning. With this approach, solutions to the problems are learned implicitly from training data, and inspecting their correctness is not possible directly. This presents concerns when the resulting systems are used to support safety-critical functions, as is the case with autonomous driving of automotive vehicles. This thesis studies the safety concerns related to learning systems within autonomous driving and applies a safety monitoring approach to a collision avoidance scenario. Experiments are performed using a simulated environment, with a deep learning system supporting perception for vehicle control, and a safety monitor for collision avoidance. The related operational situations and safety constraints are studied for an autonomous driving function, with potential faults in the learning system introduced and examined. Also, an example is considered for a measure that indicates trustworthiness of the learning system during operation.\n\niv\n\nv\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI would like to thank all the people who contributed in some way to this thesis project.

Automation systems are needed to deliver important functions that can be safety critical. Safety concerns become more difficult to tackle when the solutions to complex automation problems emerge from deep learning or machine learning, and involve elements that are non deterministic, and difficult to inspect for correctness. The research questions are formulated in this section, along with the corresponding delimitations. An outline of the thesis is then presented, followed by a list of contributions.\n\nAutomation is expected to continue to take on important functions in various products and services used by society. In safety-critical applications, faults in automation can have great consequences such as loss of life, damage to property, and financial losses. The safety of such systems needs to be assured with good confidence. The focus of this thesis is particularly on automation within autonomous driving. The SAE J3016 standard [1] describes five levels of driving automation, ranging from basic driver assistance in level 1, to full automation under all driving situations in level 5. The commercially available technology is currently at level 2, and higher levels are being developed. Audi has recently announced its A8 model for 2018 featuring level 3 automation [2]. With level 3, automated systems control the vehicle and monitor the environment under some driving modes, but a human driver is expected to intervene when requested as a fall-back measure.\n\nEmbedded systems are essential to many automation functionalities in autonomous vehicles. Several definitions exist for embedded systems, and more commonly relate to hardware and software aspects. For example, [3] offers a concise definition where \"Embedded systems are systems which include a computer but are not used for general purpose computing.\" From a systems engineering perspective, a definition that can be suitable for the context of functional safety in autonomous driving is that an embedded system is \"a system that is part of a larger system and performs some special purpose for that system (in contrast to a general-purpose part that is meant to be continuously configured to meet the demands of its users)\" [4]. Common in applications with embedded systems is the requirement for real-time interaction with the world. Several subjects areas assist in the systematic design of embedded systems for safety: safety engineering, systems engineering, formal methods, and software testing.\n\nApart from safety, also several ethical and legal matters need to be considered when driving decisions are provided by algorithms. An interesting dilemma is discussed in [5] regarding how an algorithm should choose between two evils. This includes cases such as whether the algorithm should decide to sacrifice the vehicle's passengers in order to save a greater number of other people, or should it decide to protect the passengers at all cost. The answer to such a question depends on moral and philosophical viewpoints that vary across societies and individuals. A new General Data Protection Regulation, summarized in [6], is planned to be enforced across the EU in 2018. In this law, the user should be able to obtain an explanation regarding an algorithmic decision made on his/her behalf.\n\nSeveral technologies are employed in the automotive industry and academia for monitoring the vehicle's environment, which include cameras, Radar, Lidar, and ultra-sonic sensors. The sensor data is fed to algorithms that support various functionalities, which may be of high relevance to safety. These algorithms may also be highly complex, making them difficult to analyze. The problem associated with using the sensor data for achieving the required functions is not possible to solve analytically for real world scenarios due to large input spaces (e.g. all combinations of pixel values). For such problems, solutions have emerged from the fields of Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and statistical signal processing. These approaches share a probabilistic paradigm. Depending on the method used, the probabilistic factors may or may not need to be explicitly treated when solving the problem. The answers are for some methods described in terms of probability distributions, while for other methods probabilistic factors affect the solution implicitly and are not indicated in the answers. This is especially the case with deep learning, where labeled data is used to train an artificial neural network to solve the problem. This thesis refers to systems utilizing probabilistic methods from these three fields as Learning Systems, and focuses explicitly on methods using supervised learning with labeled data used for training or statistical analysis.\n\nWhen automation is used to drive the vehicle, there are several possible points of failure in the system. These include hardware and software malfunction, problems with network delays/synchronization, mechanical problems, and also the behavior of the learning systems used. Investigating the safety impacts of these elements in the real world for autonomous driving can be infeasible and also dangerous. This motivates alternative methods that instead involve the use of simulations. Of relevance also is the ISO 26262 [7] standard, which covers functional safety for electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems in passenger vehicles, including software. This thesis focuses on the safety concerns with using learning systems in autonomous driving. The next section introduces the research questions that will be addressed.\n\n1.1 Research Questions\n\nThe research questions investigated in this thesis are stated as follows:\n\n1. What are the concerns when learning systems are used in safety critical applications, specifically in the pursuit of higher levels of autonomous driving (SAE level 3 and higher)?\n\n• Learning algorithms are affected by probabilistic factors inherent in their design. What are the concerns if we need to assure their safety in high-criticality automotive applications?\n\n• What are the implications when we need to comply with ISO 26262, specifically with regard to clauses 7 and 8 of part 3, which address hazard analysis, risk assessment, and the functional safety concept?\n\n2. Given the challenges with regards to safety-assurance of learning systems, what solutions can be considered?\n\n• What are the prominent formal methods approaches, and how can we assess their suitability for different applications? For example: is it helpful to use methods that verify mathematical properties of inputs and outputs for the learning system, or is it more appropriate to introduce other architectural elements, such as safety monitors, that address behavioral/functional properties?\n\n• Using an example deep learning system in a speed control application, how could we design a simple safety monitoring solution that is feasible for this scenario. Would the monitor design complexity present challenges?\n\n3. Due to cost and safety considerations for prototyping autonomous speed control systems in a physical environment, how can simulations assist in testing safety monitors and learning systems? What are the needed elements in the simulator to support safety studies of vision based learning systems? What commercial tools can we identify and test for this setup?\n\n1.2 Delimitations\n\nSome delimitations were made in order to better address the main focus of this work, while others had to be imposed due to limited project time and resources. Below is a list of the delimitations.\n\n• The aim in this project is to study safety concerns with (supervised) learning systems and how safety can be assured for an example automotive application. Designing a high performing learning system is not a primary objective, and could even defeat the purpose of our investigation. Beyond achieving basic performance for conducting experiments, optimizing performance can also use up excess project time, considering the limited computational resources available.\n\n• A discussion is presented regarding clauses 7 and 8 of the ISO 26262 part 3, which relate to hazard analysis and functional safety at the concept phase. Other parts of the standard are not discussed unless there is a need to reference them. The focus is on studying safety for learning systems at a conceptual level rather than undertaking product development activities.\n\n• Although a safety monitoring strategy is developed for the general scenario of combined longitudinal and lateral motion, only the simpler frontal collision avoidance monitoring is tested in simulations.\n\n• The approach presented in this thesis uses a model of the leading vehicle's expected future trajectory in collision avoidance. However, this is not addressed in any depth, and only the case of a fixed leading vehicle is considered.\n\n• Fault tolerance within the control system by incorporating sensor fusion using different types of sensors is not considered. Although the simplicity of the design presented in Section 4.2 could be criticized, the focus in this thesis is not on sensor solutions yielding high robustness and performance, but rather is on the fundamental safety challenges with learning systems, and handling faults at an architectural level.\n\n• A prototype vision-based speed control system will be developed in later sections. Imperfections in the image data due to noise, distortions, motion blur, are not incorporated, as this introduces unneeded variables to the study, and also increases computational demands in preparing experiments. The main interest is in the fundamental safety concerns when deploying learning systems in safety critical applications. Noise or imperfect data is a problem that is not specific to learning systems. Also for safety monitoring, the focus is on the functionality assuming perfect input information.\n\n• An example measure is discussed and tested as an indicator of the learning system's trustworthiness during operation. The development of better indicators, or the investigation of desired properties of such indicators has not been attempted in this work.\n\n1.3 Research Method\n\nTo address the goals for this thesis, literature is examined on relevant topics and a demo is built in a simulation environment. Relevant literature is identified on learning systems, especially with regard to safety and how the problem can be defined in the context of safety. Also, the types of learning systems that are most relevant in autonomous driving are identified, along with particular safety concerns with their use. The ISO 26262 is consulted for a recommendation on how to meet safety goals given the challenges with assuring the safety of learning systems. Literature is also examined on formal methods, and how they can fit into safety assurance for autonomous driving, beginning with the SMOF approach [8, 9] which is of interest at the Embedded Control Systems devision at KTH. The knowledge and experience gained is then demoed in a virtual vehicle simulation setup, and experiments are performed to further examine the safety concerns and seek insights.\n\n1.4 Thesis Outline\n\nThis thesis studies the safety concerns with learning systems delivering critical functionalities in autonomous driving, and investigates an architectural approach for meeting safety requirements. This section introduces the topic of safety in the context of autonomous driving, and the use of learning systems in safety-critical applications. Section 2 discusses the safety concerns, as well as the use of learning systems for autonomous driving. This is followed by a discussion of the ISO 26262 standard and the architectural approach to addressing safety is considered. Section 2.3 reviews the literature on safety monitoring and identifies a promising approach. Section 3 applies the safety monitoring approach to the context of collision avoidance. A case study is presented in Section 4, in which simulation is used to support safety studies of safety monitoring and control. The control system considered uses camera images as input, and utilizes deep learning. An indicator is presented for the trustworthiness of the learning system during operation. Experiments are then performed to study safety and test collision avoidance. Finally, Section 5 discusses and summarizes the work in this thesis, and offers suggestions for further research.\n\n1.5 Contributions\n\nThe contributions of this thesis are the following:\n\n• A discussion is made of the safety concerns with deploying learning systems in safety critical automotive applications in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. Safety monitoring approaches are also discussed along with their complexity considerations in Section 2.3.\n\n• Models for longitudinal as well as combined longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance scenarios are developed and used within a safety monitoring approach in Section 3.1.\n\n• An approach to safety distance calculation based on time varying relative acceleration models is presented in Section 3.2. Constant acceleration models are shown to offer relatively optimistic safety distances in comparison, which is not desirable.\n\n• The use of simulations for supporting safety studies of camera-based learning systems is discussed in Section 4.1, and three simulation tools, IPG CarMaker, TESIS DYNAware, and TASS PreScan are considered for this application.\n\n• A simulation-based approach is presented in Section 4.3 for performing safety studies with camera-based vehicle control, where a full control and safety toolchain can be tested. Experiments with malfunctioning behaviors in a vision-based speed control system are also presented. An architectural safety monitoring approach is applied and demonstrated for collision avoidance in case of hazardous speed control behavior.\n\n• An example runtime indicator is presented in Section 4.3.4, for the trustworthiness of a vision-based speed control system. Such an indicator can help warn in advance before severe safety interventions are needed.\n\n2 Background\n\nThis section presents the background relevant to the discussions of this thesis. A function approximation view of learning systems is introduced and used to discuss safety concerns. Applications for learning systems in autonomous driving are then discussed, with particular mention of the end-to-end approach to solving automation problems, and the safety implications that arise. The ISO 26262 is discussed for this context, and an architectural approach to safety is considered. Safety monitoring is then introduced, and a promising approach in the literature is identified.\n\nAlthough developments in automation may yield good performance, and even eliminate sources of human error, there are several sources of failures that introduce hazards. For the case where the automation systems employ learning algorithms, these sources can include unreliable sensors, problems with the data used for training, as well as limitations in the algorithms and faults in their design.\n\nWith regard to the learning systems addressed in this thesis, Vapnik [10] provides a definition that is helpful in this context. In Vapnik's paper, learning is posed as a problem of function approximation involving three components:\n\n1. A generator of random vectors x, drawn independently from a fixed but unknown distribution P (x).\n\n2. A supervisor which returns an output vector y to every input vector x, according to a conditional distribution function P (y|x), also fixed but unknown.\n\n3. A learning machine capable of implementing a set of functions f(x,w), where w ∈W is a set of parameters to be learned.\n\nTo illustrate these components in an example application, consider the case where a deep neural network classifies input images. The generator would be the training images used to train the network, with each image being a vector x in Vapnik's model. The supervisor would be the ground truth labeling process for the training images, where the class label is encoded in the output vector y referred to above. A commonly used distinction in machine learning literature is between supervised and unsupervised learning. In the former, ground truth labels are available, as is the case in our image classification example. With unsupervised learning on the other hand, ground truth labels are not available and other mechanisms are used. A key point is that P (y|x) is unknown, and in effect sampled for available x vectors. Finally, the implementation of the particular deep neural network architecture would constitute the learning machine. The term w refers to the network parameters such as the weights and biases. The resulting output of the neural network, depends on the input image x, and the network parameters w used, which are determined by the training process. The concept of learning systems discussed in this thesis uses this function approximation view of supervised learning. A discussion is presented in [11, 12] on the critical role of training data and loss functions, which represent training objectives, for the safety of machine learning systems. For the loss functions, the authors note that with quantities related to performance or prediction error, the human cost that is relevant for safety may not be accounted for. For example, consider the trivial scenario where the steering angle for a vehicle is learned by a neural network from labeled data. The quantities relevant for safety may include the risk of collision, and the risk of injury or death, which depend on the operating environment. If the backpropagation method is used with the angle error alone, these safety considerations are not incorporated in the loss function. Also, arguments based on laws of large numbers (e.g. average error) may not be suitable when considering safety, since safety-critical cases may be rare and underrepresented in an aggregate quantity. Two concerns are noted by the authors for the training data\n\n• The training samples may not be drawn from the underlying distribution, P (y|x). For the image classification example, consider the case when the training images are produced by ideal sensors, and contain no noise, distortions, or motion blur, but the actual P (y|x) needed for the application is for non-ideal realistic images. By using ideal training images, the training samples were drawn from a different distribution than P (y|x). In addition, the difference between the target distribution and the distribution from which training samples are drawn may not be easily understood or possible to account for.\n\n• The training samples are absent in parts of the x vector space. This can especially be the case for rare, low probability, x regions. Safety relevant rare conditions may be insufficiently represented, or not represented at all.\n\nThere may be other concerns the authors do not explicitly include, such as the formulation of the learning problem with adequate and suitable information to infer outputs. This can be viewed as sampling from P (y|z) when P (y|x) is the needed distribution for the problem. If the mapping between z and x is many-to-one, then simply extra training data would be needed. If the mapping is one-to-many, or many-to-many then nondeterminism is introduced, affecting the potential for inferring the output. Overfitting is another problem in supervised learning, which is related to the complexity of the learned system (e.g. the number of weights) relative to the amount of training data. A complex model can fit exactly a set of points that draw a straight line with an added noise, however, it will generalize very poorly on unseen data compared to a simple model for a straight line. This can be related to the discussion on the loss functions. When using only the error in the loss function, the complex model would be favored, however, an additional term can be incorporated to avoid overfitting by penalizing model complexity. This technique is known as regularization. Overfitting can also be related to causality and interpretability. The higher model complexity can allow for fitting noise and vagaries in the training data that are not part of the underlying physics, and also make the model more difficult to understand.\n\nThe authors suggest four strategies for improving safety:\n\n• Inherently Safe Design Causality and interpretability can be insisted on in the design of systems, which allows for the behavior of the models in response to inputs to be understood and verified. Irrelevant input and output variables need to be eliminated, to expose the main \"physics\" of the system governing its functional and safety properties. Interpretability refers to the possibility of understanding the models and their operation, for e.g. whether a model is black box, gray box, white box, etc. Interpretable models can much more easily be examined with respect to safety or other properties. The authors, do not include causality as a safety concern beside the training data and loss functions above, but it can contribute an offset between the target and training data distributions. For example, consider the case discussed in the previous paragraph regarding sampling from P (y|z) when P (y|x) is the needed instead.\n\n• Safety Reserves In [11, 12], this refers to optimizing not only with respect to the model parameters, but also with respect to uncertainties in training data. A practical example is not suggested, but the key is to consider the worst case outcome while varying uncertainties, whether due to training and test distribution mismatch or instantiation of the test set. It is also suggested to consider fairness and equitability, so that certain groups are not underrepresented for safety.\n\n• Safe Fail With this strategy, the system may elect a reject option, in which it does not attempt to predict the output for the given input sample. For example, in regions that are too close to decision boundaries, or regions that correspond to rare input conditions, a safe fail would be to ask the human operator to intervene.\n\n• Procedural Safeguards User experience design can help guide practitioners on how to correctly setup the machine learning system. This includes the training data set, evaluation procedures, and other elements. If automated design processes are performed by users who are not deeply knowledgeable of the systems and associated safety concerns, incorrect use can be a concern. Another procedural safeguard is to have the possibility of public audit of source code, so that potential problems can be discovered. Having the data source publicly available is also suggested by the authors.\n\nThe next section discusses some autonomous driving applications from the literature with regard to safety. Following this, the relevant safety standard for such applications is considered, and then the topic of safety monitoring is introduced.\n\n2.1 Safety Issues When Using Learning Systems for Autonomous Driving\n\nA pioneering work in this area is [13] from 1989, where a neural network computes the steering angle for a vehicle using camera and laser rangefinder inputs. This approach later came to be called end-to-end learning, since the algorithms are not hand designed. After the introduction of convolutional neural networks (CNN), end-to-end learning was utilized in a famous project by LeCun et al. [14], to drive a model truck on unknown open terrain while avoiding obstacles. More recently, advancements have been made in CNNs for vision tasks, which were driven by improvements in computational resources and network designs with more hidden layers. Networks with large amount of layers are referred to as \"deep\" networks in the literature, with the corresponding phrase \"deep learning\" also used. [15] used Deep CNN for end-to-end steering in lane and road following.\n\nThe main attraction with the end-to-end approach is that no domain expertise is required on how the system should solve the problem. Although some expertise would be required for selecting a suitable training data set and loss functions for the problem, the process for solving the problem is inferred implicitly from data.\n\nRelating to the interpretability concept mentioned earlier, end-to-end systems can be viewed as uninterpretable, black box, computations. Consider that solving the main problem controlling a vehicle using vision information consists of several logical subproblems, such as: lane tracking, scene understanding, vehicle state awareness, coordinating with other vehicles, action policy, and others. The logic of how an end-to-end system solves the main problem is not understood, neither is the correctness of the solutions to each logical subproblem. This presents a safety concern in its own right, and compounds the previously mentioned challenges regarding adequate training data.\n\nFor safety, training data needs to cover rare cases that exercise all logical subsystems of an end-to-end system. To illustrate the challenge, consider a problem composed of two subproblems: PA and PB. Since with end-to-end systems the solutions to the subproblems are not inspected separately, faults in one subproblem may be masked in the aggregate system. Consider fault FA which affects the solution to PA. Due to a masking affect, this particular fault may not always be detected in the aggregate system. Rather than requiring simply that the training data accounts for FA, in an end-to-end system the data needs to exercise FA such that it is detectable in the aggregate system. The rarity of needed data could be much higher than if subproblems could be inspected separately. As the complexity of problems increases for end-to-end systems, it becomes increasingly harder to alleviate safety concerns associated with adequate training data.\n\nAnalytical methods for verification of properties of deep networks have been proposed in the literature [16, 17]. However, these methods use a mathematical view of the system's inputs and outputs, where one needs to specify safety properties concerning the values of input pixels and output quantities. Even if this could be achieved, the likely complex methods required for deriving such specifications would need verification efforts of their own.\n\nNext, a brief discussion is presented of some relevant portions of the ISO 26262 safety standard, in relation to safety critical autonomous driving applications.\n\n2.2 The ISO 26262 Standard\n\nAs the automotive industry aims at higher levels of automation, there is a trend of increasing complexity in the various software, hardware, and mechatronic systems deployed in vehicles. Due to the challenges in scaling the safety assurance with system complexity, as well as the critical application areas involved, safety becomes increasingly a major issue. The ISO 26262 [7] standard addresses the functional safety of electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems within road vehicles, which for example include systems for: driver assistance, propulsion, and vehicle dynamics control. Safety requirements can be at the technical or functional level. Technical safety requirements pertain to safety of systems at the technical implementation level, and can for example include: voltage limits, memory requirements, speed ranges, safety distances, reaction times, etc. Functional safety requirements, on the other hand is implementation-independent, and relates to a higher level of abstraction which addresses behaviors of systems in response to inputs. This can involve, for example: actuator actions, computational flow within software, and transitions across system states. For functional safety, the system as a whole needs to be considered, along with the environment in which it operates.\n\nThe aim in the ISO 26262 is to assure the absence of unreasonable risk due to hazards caused by malfunctioning behavior of E/E systems, including software. The standard provides an automotive safety lifecycle, with a framework for the elimination of hazards and minimizing residual risk. The Safety Integrity Level is an important concept in the standard, pertaining to the amount of rigor in safety requirements that would be suitable for the amount of risk involved. Also, requirements for validation of safety and for relations with suppliers are addressed in the ISO 26262.\n\nAn overview of the ISO 26262 is shown in Figure 1. For the safety studies of learning systems presented in this thesis, the clauses in the standard which are most relevant are clauses 7 and 8 of part 3, addressing hazard analysis and functional safety at the concept phase of product development. The focus of this work is on the fundamental concerns with the use of learning systems. Safety within management, product development, and production activities is not of direct relevance, and is hence not discussed.\n\nFigure 1: ISO 26262 overview [7]. Copyright remains with ISO (used with permission).\n\n2.2.1 Hazard analysis, risk assessment and ASIL determination\n\nIn the ISO 26262, the term \"item\" is used to refer to a system or array of systems that implements a function at the vehicle level, and to which the standard is applied. The item of interest in the investigations presented in this thesis can be defined as the autonomous driving function achieved via learning systems, without specifying any particular choice of learning systems, or the type of input and interfaces they involve. An example of such an item discussed in Section 4 is a speed control system using a deep neural network vision system. That item takes camera images of the road as input, and outputs brake and acceleration levels.\n\nDuring hazard analysis and risk assessment the item is evaluated without internal safety mechanisms, with regard to its potential hazardous events (i.e. combinations of hazards and operational situations). Hazards that can result also from foreseeable misuse shall be analyzed. The hazards that can be triggered by malfunctions in the item are identified, and safety goals for the prevention or mitigation of the hazardous events are formulated.\n\nThe standard requires for hazards to be determined systematically. Some hazard analysis techniques mentioned in the standard are Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Hazardous events and their associated safety goals are assigned Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs), which are determined according to an assessment of the severity, probability of exposure, and controllability of the hazards. Figure 2 shows the classification classes for these factors.\n\nFigure 2: ISO 26262 classification of hazardous events [7].\n\nExposure and controllability assessments use estimates for the probability of exposure to hazardous situations, and the probability of avoiding harm, respectively. For classes E1-E4 and C1-C3, the difference in probability from one class to the next is an order of magnitude. It has been suggested in [18] to avoid probabilistic assessments as they bring in subjectivity for assumptions and analyses about the system, and that ASIL assessment entails a tension between safety and business competitiveness considerations for manufacturers. The assignment of ASIL in the standard using the severity, exposure, and controllability classes is shown in Figure 3.\n\nIn the collision avoidance scenarios discussed in this thesis, the hazard represents a situation where the vehicle may collide with obstacles due to failures in control functionalities achieved via learning systems. The corresponding safety goal is to avoid colliding with obstacles due to malfunctioning vehicle control from learning systems. Collisions can lead to fatal injuries, which are not avoidable without safety measures. This requires severity class S3, and a controllability class C3 classifications. Exposure refers to the relative frequency of exposure to the possibility of the hazard occurring. For example, hazardous events related to airbags have low exposure since airbags rarely deploy, while hazardous events related to braking systems have high exposure as braking is relevant in many driving situations. For example, an omission failure or braking, is relevant and dangerous in many driving situations - thus having high exposure. In the context of safety critical learning systems used in autonomous driving, the exposure is high when essential driving functions are automated. This would require an exposure classification of E4. The ASIL that results from these severity, exposure, and controllability classifications is an ASIL D. Furthermore, a challenge when using use a data-driven design process rather than analytic methods, is the presence of not only known unknown factors, but also unknown unknowns that are difficult to account for in probability assessment.\n\nFigure 3: ASIL assignment in ISO 26262 [7]\n\nThe ISO 26262-9:2011, Clause 5, offers an opportunity to implement safety requirements by independent architectural elements, and assign a potentially lower ASIL to the decomposed safety requirements. This is referred to as ASIL decomposition. For learning systems whose safety is difficult to analyze and verify, it can be desirable to divert away safety compliance efforts to simpler architectural elements that achieve the safety goals. For the ASIL D safety goal of avoiding collisions due to learning systems' functions, Clause 5.4.10, allows a decomposition into one ASIL D(D) requirement and one QM(D) requirement. The class QM (quality management) denotes that complying with the standard is not required. The ASIL QM(D) can be assigned to the learning system responsible for the autonomous driving functions, while an ASIL D(D) requirement can be assigned to a dedicated safety monitor for which it is simpler to assure safety compliance.\n\n2.2.2 Functional safety concept\n\nClause 8 of ISO 26262-3 addresses the functional safety concept, which involves the allocation of functional safety requirements to architectural elements of the item, or to external measures. With the safety goal of avoiding collisions stated earlier decomposed into one ASIL D(D) requirement and one QM(D) requirement, an architectural element can be introduced to satisfy the ASIL D(D) requirement, while the original learning system can be exempt from needing to comply with the standard. The ASIL D(D) safety requirement can simply be to avoid colliding with obstacles. The added architectural element for this requirement can be considered as a safety monitor or a collision avoidance system.\n\nThe exact definition for this system would vary with implementation and technology choices, including the type of sensors used and the available system outputs. ASIL decomposition helps to divert safety assurance efforts from the complex systems that employ learning systems. However, complexity in the safety monitoring device can also increase verification efforts and should be minimized.\n\nIn this thesis, safety is addressed not by attempting to verify the safety properties of learning systems, and not by employing strategies that foster safety within learning systems. Instead, the idea is for safety concerns to be diverted to a separate architectural component for achieving the needed safety goals, whose verification is much simpler. Safety monitoring is considered for applications where the learning system drives the vehicle. Only accidents associated with colliding with obstacles are addressed, for which case collision avoidance is of relevance, and safety monitoring should achieve this function.\n\n2.3 The Safety Monitoring Approach to Safety\n\nSafety monitoring is not a new paradigm, although other terms have also been used to describe the approach. An early work in this area is [19] from 1987, which shows a formal methods approach that generates a supervisor from a system model and a constraint model both expressed as automata. The supervisor issues inhibitions to prevent hazardous actions. An example offered is when two users should not simultaneously access a shared resource. The objective would be to inhibit transitions in order to satisfy synchronization requirements. The authors provide a formal approach to proving that the needed supervisor exists, and that the corresponding synthesis problem is solvable.\n\nAutomated tools have been developed for verifying properties of automata models, known as model checkers. Model checkers exhaustively check the reachable states of the model. If the property holds, the model checker confirms it with full certainty, and provides some diagnostic information otherwise. Model checking has been used in the design of safety monitors. Siminiceanu and Ciardo [20] use their SMART model checker to verify the design and expose potential problems with the NASA airport runway safety monitor, which detects incursions and alert pilots.\n\nWith increasing complexity in system behavior and its environment, more descriptive models become needed, and their state space size increases. This presents a scalability challenge when using model checkers, since all the reachable states need to be checked. This is referred to as the \"state space explosion\" problem. In [20], the popular NuSMV and SPIN model checkers were found not feasible for the runway safety monitoring application with a large state space.\n\nOne other consideration is that embedded systems exhibit both event-driven and time-driven phenomena. To represent such systems, hybrid models are used which include both discrete and continuous variables. Model checkers for hybrid systems exist, notably [21], however the computational complexity in model checking hybrid models is larger than for discrete models, which present further scalability difficulties. In applications where an implicitly discrete view of time and other continuous variables is used (e.g. due to sampling and quantization), it can be suitable to use discrete models.\n\nRuntime verification is another paradigm related to model checking. Rather than using a model checker to verify the safety monitor offline, the safety monitor checks the execution of the system online. In effect, not all possible system executions are exhaustively checked, but only those that are encountered during system operation. This provides a fault detection mechanism. A key difference with model checking is that no model for the system is needed. A runtime verification architecture is proposed in [3] for safety-critical embedded systems. In this approach, execution traces are analyzed during system operation and checked against formal specifications. A separate controller is then triggered if a violation occurs. The focus of this work is more on the technical level, relating to the technical operation of systems. An example offered by the author is the following: \"If the brake pedal has been pressed, then within 200ms cruise control should be disengaged for 100ms.\"\n\nFor collision avoidance, the top level safety goal is at the functional level, relating to the behavior of the vehicle within its environment. For complex scenarios, model checking can help ensure that this goal is achieved by the safety monitor, also if using runtime verification.\n\nThe work presented in this thesis will use the SMOF safety monitoring framework where the supervisor issues interventions, following [8, 9]. In this SMOF approach, the state space is partitioned into safe, warning, and critical regions. The safety monitor triggers interventions upon the system entering the warning regions to insure that transitions into critical regions are prevented. The authors also present an automated tool for the identification of warning states, and the synthesis of safety strategies given the available interventions. The main promise in the SMOF tool is the capability to produce a safety monitor given a system and a set of available interventions.\n\n2.3.1 Application to Collision Avoidance\n\nCollision avoidance (CA) requires not only the abstract safety rules that can be obtained with SMOF, but also the implementation of these rules. This includes detection and tracking of obstacles, and the needed planning and action steps for avoiding a collision. An overview of collision avoidance systems is found in [22]. It is noted that collision avoidance per se is not always attainable in automotive applications, and collision mitigation is a more realistic focus, i.e. reducing the severity of accidents. One main challenge, is defining the conditions in which the CA system should intervene. The author suggests examples where vehicles meet in a narrow road allowing little separation, and overtaking maneuvers that can be confused with imminent dangers. These challenges present a trade-off between effectiveness and unneeded interventions. Also, the work compares steering and braking maneuvers in terms of efficiency. For avoiding a head-on collision, with constant acceleration models the author shows that the needed separation distance is much higher with braking than steering as the initial speed increases. In fact, it was shown that with constant acceleration models, the separation distance is proportional to the square of velocity for braking, but linearly proportional to velocity for steering. The concept of \"decision functions\" is also presented in [22], in which dynamic models of the ego and other vehicles, as well as assumptions of future actions are basis for CA intervention decisions. Constant velocity and constant acceleration dynamic models are presented for estimating future trajectories. Several measures have been discussed for assessing the corresponding collision threat, including: distance, time to collision, closest point of approach, required acceleration, and others.\n\nThis thesis will present a different approach for integrating the two components, which is in alignment with the SMOF approach. Rather than using constant acceleration models, an approach will be shown involving time varying acceleration models for calculating the needed safety distance dynamically at run time, rather than only indicating a threat level or warning. This framework also allows for flexibility in defining the expectation of future actions of obstacles, which can be of help with the previously mentioned confusing scenarios (meeting at narrow roads and overtaking). However, this is not within the scope of this thesis and is not presented. In the following section, the main methodology is presented along with an example.\n\n3 Safety Monitoring for Collision Avoidance\n\nThis section applies the SMOF safety monitoring approach to the context collision avoidance, both for the longitudinal (front and back) and lateral (sideways) cases. Next, the problem is formulated and the SMOF rule synthesis tool is tested with models for the two cases. The latter case will involve a much larger state space. After obtaining safety rules, the technical implementation of these rules is addressed.\n\n3.1 SMOF for Collision Avoidance\n\nIn the SMOF framework, the safety system is responsible for monitoring safety and triggering interventions when the system transitions into a warning state. A formal description of the problem is presented next, but the reader may skip to Section 3.1.1 for an implementation of this approach. In the SMOF framework, the tasks may be viewed as follows:\n\n1. Let the vehicle's surrounding regions be represented by a set of nondeterministic finite state machines (FSMs) Ri, i = 1, 2, 3, ...n, each possessing its own set of states Si, generators Σi, and\n\ntransition relations −→i with which jointly the FSMs satisfy constraints related to interdependency of different regions. Let the joint system be denoted by T = {R1, R2, R3, ..., Rn} with the space of possible states S, transition relations −→, and generators Σ. Given a catastrophic combination of the sets Sc ∈ S, obtain the set of predecessor warning states Sw\n\nSw = Pre(Sc) := { sw ∈ S : ∃σ ∈ Σ,∃sc ∈ Sc, sw σ−→ sc\n\n} .\n\n2. Specify the available monitor interventions that if associated to warning states sw ∈ Sw transitions into catastrophic states can be possibly canceled. This can also be viewed as introducing an additional FSM (the monitor), so that the joint system can have no catastrophic states. Let the monitor be given by M(Sm,Σm,−→m), T′ = {M,T} denotes the joint system with the monitor. The monitor's states are derived from the states of Ri through a function F . In other words, Sm = F (S1, S2, S3, ..., Sn). To cancel catastrophic transitions some dependency has to exist also between the generators of Ri and the monitor's generators. The task at this step is to suggest the monitor's state derivations and generators, such that a cancellation of catastrophic transitions can be possible.\n\n3. Find the possible mappings between the available monitor interventions and the warning states sw ∈ Sw such that the catastrophic states are no longer reachable. In the FSM view of the monitor, we need to now find the transition relation such that @σm ∈ Σm, sc ∈ Sc that satisfy F−1(sm) σm−−→m sc. In the Joint system, the critical states are unreachable.\n\nReferring back to the collision avoidance problem, the vehicle's autonomous driving systems contribute an additional actor P to T′. Its states that are relevant to safety are contained in the space of possible states for the system with no monitor Sp ⊂ S, but the generators Σ and transition relations −→ of T are pessimistically unconstrained by those of P .\n\nIn a comprehensive collision avoidance scenario, the vehicle's surrounding regions need to be considered longitudinally to avoid collisions from the front and back, laterally to avoid collisions from the sides, as well as possibly under the vehicle to avoid tires running on hazardous objects below. The boundaries for the zones depend on the possibilities for hazards and monitor interventions, and must be chosen such that intervention specifications are implementable. This thesis will next discuss a longitudinal collision avoidance model, and build up to a model for combined longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance.\n\n3.1.1 Longitudinal Collision Avoidance\n\nFor the longitudinal case, an occupancy grid is considered in the form shown in Figure 4, consisting of safe, warning and critical regions. The boundaries of the regions, in terms of both shape and distance, are beyond the scope of SMOF, and are treated separately as technical specifications.\n\nIn the figure, the critical region isRc, and the two warning regions areRf andRb, which respectively represent the front and back of the vehicle. With this simple model, the possibilities for obstacles to emerge into the critical region from below, or descend from above are not supported.\n\nFigure 4: Occupancy grid for longitudinal model\n\nThe occupancy state of each warning region is modeled using a finite state machine, shown in Figure 5. The state begins with the region empty, and can become occupied if an object approaches. After which, the object may either continue to approach, or become relatively stationary. At this point, the status cannot change to empty before the object departs first.\n\nFigure 5: Finite state machine representation of region status\n\nThe SMOF tool uses a template NuSMV model that includes a model of the system, and a model of accident causality. The occupancy FSM was implemented as a NuSMV module and instantiated in two variables representing the Rf and Rb regions. The accident model used defines an accident as an approaching state for two consecutive time steps in any region.\n\nThe tool identified the seven expected warning states:\n\n• an approach in Rf , with empty, stationary, or departing Rb\n\n• an approach in Rb, with empty, stationary, or departing Rf\n\n• an approach in both Rf and Rb\n\nThe next step is to suggest interventions that can be used to synthesize safety strategies. The two obvious interventions for longitudinal collision avoidance would be to brake and to accelerate. The technical specification of interventions, as for physical boundaries of regions and time step, are beyond the scope of the SMOF methodology, and are to be addressed separately. However, the interventions suggested must be implementable for any resulting safety strategies to be viable. Braking is defined, at this stage, as simply braking sufficiently such that if a frontal approach occurs it does not persist in the next time step. The accelerate intervention is defined also in a similar way, assuming suitable technical implementation.\n\nThe brake and accelerate interventions are not adequate in the case of approaching states simultaneously in the two regions. As would be expected, the SMOF tool fails to find a safety strategy. To demonstrate the tool's synthesis capability, a third intervention has been added to allow for the possibility of avoiding accidents by transferring control to other systems or the driver. This could be criticized due to the various implementation challenges with such an intervention. Notwithstand- ing, the transfer control intervention is assumed to be viable, and used simply to demonstrate safety strategy synthesis with SMOF.\n\nThe tool identifies four strategies. The expected strategy has been found, as shown below, while the other three strategies involve transferring control also when not approached simultaneously from the front and back.\n\n• brake following a frontal approach\n\n• accelerate following a backward approach\n\n• transfer control following simultaneously both a forward and backward approach\n\nThis example demonstrates the SMOF approach and tool, where the safety monitoring rules are produced automatically according to user supplied models. The next section develops a model for combined longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance.\n\n3.1.2 Longitudinal and Lateral Collision Avoidance\n\nIn this combined scenario, the lateral motion is accounted for in addition to the longitudinal motion modeled in the previous section, as well as the interaction between the two. This allows the following possibilities not available in the previous case:\n\n• With awareness of the lateral dimension, collisions from the sides may also be avoided, rather than only the front and back.\n\n• The safety distance needed can be lower if collisions can be avoided with steering, or both steering and longitudinal control.\n\nAs was previously noted, specification of region boundaries, the time step, as well as the technical implementation of interventions is beyond the scope of the SMOF approach. The occupancy grid considered is shown in Figure 6, with in addition to the Rf and Rb regions, the left and right regions Rl and Rr are included. The possibility for lower safety distance due to steering is not aimed at in this model, as it would require being able to differentiate between the left and right regions within both Rf and Rb (for example, steering left does not avoid obstacles at the front-left direction). This would require additional variables, and result in a larger state space. As was noted previously, state space explosion is a major concern with model checking.\n\nFigure 6: Occupancy grid for combined longitudinal and lateral model\n\nUsing the same set of states as before, one way to model the combined longitudinal and lateral motion is to simply enumerate all possible combinations. For the longitudinal model, one region was described using four states. Lateral motion can be described similarly using the same four states. The number of combinations is 16. The number of transitions to set would then be 16 × 16 = 256. This approach was not pursued, although it is the obvious way. Instead, the previous model in Figure 5 was adapted with one instance used for each of the longitudinal and lateral motions within a region. Then, a few constraints were imposed to model the dependencies between lateral and longitudinal states within a region.\n\nEach warning region is described by two FSMs of the form shown in Figure 7, one for the longitudinal and another for the lateral states.\n\nFigure 7: Finite state machine representation of longitudinal/lateral components\n\nCompared to the previous FSM, now all transitions are possible, due to motion from the other direction. To account for the interdependencies between the two FSMs, the following constraints are added (⇐⇒ and =⇒ denote logical equivalence and implication, respectively)\n\n• empty laterally ⇐⇒ empty longitudinally\n\n• longitudinally stationary or departing without previous approach =⇒ lateral approach\n\n• longitudinally approaching and previously departing =⇒ lateral approach (previous object exited and new one entered)\n\n• longitudinally empty and previously stationary or approaching =⇒ previous lateral depart\n\n• laterally stationary or departing without previous approach =⇒ longitudinal approach\n\n• laterally approaching and previously departing =⇒ longitudinal approach\n\n• laterally empty and previously stationary or approaching =⇒ previous longitudinal depart\n\nFirst the SMOF approach was attempted only with two regions, Rf and Rr. Accidents can be caused either by continuous longitudinal approach from the front, or continuous lateral approach from the right. The tool identified 51 warning states, which comprise of cases with either a frontal longitudinal approach, or a right lateral approach.\n\nTwo interventions were then used: braking and left steering. As explained in the previous section, the technical implementation of the interventions is not covered in the SMOF approach. Braking is defined as previously: decelerating sufficiently such that if a frontal approach occurs it does not persist in the next time step. Left steering is defined in a similar way with no reference to implementation. The tool finds the expected strategy:\n\n• brake following a frontal longitudinal approach\n\n• steer left following a right lateral approach\n\n• brake and steer left following a simultaneous frontal longitudinal approach and right lateral approach\n\nThis successfully demonstrates the SMOF tool for a more complex application than previously seen in Section 3.1.1. Next, the two missing regions were added, namely the back and left regions, and the accident model was correspondingly extended. The SMOF tool was found unfortunately not feasible even in computing the warning states for the full model.\n\nAlthough the tool has not been of assistance, this does not preclude using the SMOF architecture. Two additional interventions were added for acceleration and right steering, and a further transfer control intervention was added, following Section 3.1.1. A strategy was proposed manually and checked with NuSMV:\n\n• brake if not longitudinally approached from the back and either approached longitudinally from the front or trapped laterally\n\n• accelerate if not braking, and not longitudinally approached from the front and either approached longitudinally from the back or trapped laterally\n\n• steer left if not laterally approached from the left and either approached laterally from the right or trapped longitudinally\n\n• steer right if not steering left, and not laterally approached from the right and either approached laterally from the left or trapped longitudinally\n\n• transfer control if trapped longitudinally, and trapped laterally\n\nwhere \"trapped\" refers to when having obstacles in two opposite regions, i.e. front and back for longitudinal, while left and right for lateral trapping. In order to avoid conflicts when two opposing interventions are possible, preference is given to braking and left steering.\n\nIn the preceding sections, the SMOF tool has been demonstrated for the simple scenario of longitudinal collision avoidance, and for a more complex scenario with frontal and rightwards collision avoidance incorporating two dimensional motion. Although the tool suffered from the state space problem when applied to an even more complex model, a solution could be model checked successfully, allowing for the use of SMOF safety strategies. The main components in the SMOF approach is the partitioning of the state space to identify warning states, and the use of safety strategies, that when needed enact interventions to prevent transitions to critical states. These were achieved in all the cases considered in the previous sections. The following section examines the technical implementation aspects that need to be addressed.\n\n3.2 Safety Distance Using Time-Varying Acceleration Models\n\nGiven predicted relative acceleration â(t) between the ego vehicle and the object (e.g. a leading/trailing vehicle), and initial relative speed v0, the task is to obtain the initial separation x0 that avoids a trajectory reaching 0 distance, if this is possible for â(t) and v0. The main result is derived in Appendix A, and stated as: ∫ 0\n\nx0\n\nâ(t)dx = −1 2 v20 (1)\n\nEquation 1 gives a relation between initial velocity and required separation for time-varying acceleration. An analytic solution requires an expression for the relative acceleration a(t) in terms of x, which is not available. Alternatively, a solution can be found numerically as will be shown in the next section. For the constant acceleration case the equation reduces to x0 =\n\nv20\n\n2ac\n\n(2)\n\nwhere ac is the constant acceleration.\n\nTo demonstrate a numerical approach to finding the needed separation distance in terms of initial relative speed, consider that the object moves towards the ego vehicle according to predicted acceleration curve ai(t), which is initially positive but decreases as the other object reacts to the situation, and consider that the ego vehicle is capable of acceleration profile as(t) in collision avoidance. For this example, assume that the two functions are of the form\n\nai(t) = R\n\n(\n\n2\n\n1 − tanh(t)\n\n)\n\nas(t) = −ksR tanh(αs t).\n\nR is the expected possible acceleration range in m/s2. The hyperbolic tangent has been used simply due to its shape containing transient and steady-state regions. A value of 4.3403 corresponds to 0-100km/hour in 6.4 seconds. ks is a scale factor representing the amount by which the magnitude of the ego vehicle's reaction is larger than the object's reaction, and αs represents the relative quickness in responding to the situation.\n\nLet us use: R = 0.5, ks = 1.5, αs = 0.5 as example. The resulting functions are shown in Figure 8, with also the relative acceleration â(t) = ai(t) + as(t) plotted.\n\nFigure 8: Time varying accelerations of the two objects\n\nThese simple models contain two phases: a transient response and a steady-state response. This assumes that the steady-state (of acceleration) continues indefinitely, implying that no reduction in deceleration occurs, and that collision avoidance efforts can persist as long as needed. However, in practice the relative acceleration may eventually go to zero, as would be the case with braking leading to a stopped vehicle.\n\nThe relative distance trajectory x(t) is found by integrating the acceleration twice:\n\nd2x(t) dt2 = dv(t) dt\n\n= â(t)\n\nv(t) =\n\n∫ t â(τ)dτ + v0\n\nx(t) =\n\n∫ t\n\n0 ∫ γ\n\n0 0\n\nâ(τ)dτdγ + v0t+ x0.\n\nwhere v0 is the initial approach (relative) speed. For any v0, we can find the least separation (least negative x0) that ensures x(t) > 0, ∀t > 0. By iterating over different approach speeds we can obtain a relation between v0 and x0.\n\nA speed of 40km/hour corresponds to 11.12m/s. Let us consider approach speeds in the range [0.1,11.12]. Figure 9 shows the least separation solutions for the different initial speeds v0. Notice that trajectories are always non positive for all the curves. Arriving at zero separation indicates that the initial separation is minimal. Due to the prolonged steady-state acceleration seen in Figure 8, the trajectory reverses after reaching zero separation (objects just touch then separate). The trajectory after zero separation is not of relevance for collision avoidance, and can be ignored.\n\nFigure 9: Solution trajectories for different initial speeds v0\n\nFinally a relation between v0 and x0 can be obtained, as shown in Figure 10.\n\nFigure 10: v0 to x0 relation\n\nLet us now consider the constant acceleration case to find how the required initial separation distance compares to the result in Figure 10. It is not apparent how one should select a value of ac in Equation 2. As example, consider the steady-state, average, median, and 25th percentile accelerations during the initial 10 seconds. Figure 11 shows the results for these constant estimates obtained by invoking Equation 2, together with the time-varying acceleration result.\n\nFigure 11: v0 to x0 relation for constant acceleration\n\nOptimistic separation distances were found for all the constant acceleration cases. The steady-state (minimum) acceleration yielded the most optimistic separation, as would be expected. The median is the acceleration at 5s in Figure 8, which is very close to the steady state. The 25th percentile is 2.5s in the figure. The average is the most conservative but still gives optimistic separation distance. These results indicate the significance of the initial period where the approach speed is high but little deceleration is taking place.\n\nIn the approach presented in this section, collisions can be avoided if the separation is greater than the obtained safety distance value. This gives the distance boundary needed in the SMOF approach, for interventions to be viable. The calculation uses relative motion in one direction. The boundary can be constructed along any direction of interest provided the following are available along that direction:\n\n• Current speed of approach between ego vehicle and object\n\n• Knowledge of ego vehicle's acceleration capability\n\n• Expectation for future acceleration of the object\n\nOnce the object is within this physical boundary, interventions can be triggered according to the safety strategies used.\n\nNext in this thesis, a case study is presented which employs simulation to test and demonstrate SMOF safety monitoring for collision avoidance. The main motivation in this work is safety assurance for learning systems. The study will deploy a vision-based autonomous driving function, along with safety monitoring using the approach discussed thus far.\n\n4 Case Study: Safety Monitoring for Vision-Based Vehicle Control\n\nThis section presents an implementation of safety monitoring and vehicle control toolchains within a simulation environment. A deep learning system will be used to drive a simulated vehicle, and experiments will be performed to investigate safety with malfunctioning vehicle control.\n\nPrevious sections have discussed the safety concerns with learning systems in autonomous driving, and the difficulty of verifying their safety properties. Instead, an architectural safety monitoring approach is pursued in this thesis. Section 3.1 applied the SMOF safety monitoring approach to collision avoidance, and Section 3.2 discussed an approach for obtaining the distance boundary needed for interventions to be viable. This section studies a case where a learning system controls the vehicle, and develops a framework for supporting safety investigations. The scenario consists of a vision-based speed control system for longitudinal motion, along with a collision avoidance safety system to mitigate risks due to faults in the learning system.\n\nDriving simulators are of help in this study, both for generating synthetic data, and for testing the effectiveness of safety systems. The experimental approach depends greatly on the capabilities offered by the driving simulator, and computational resources available. This topic is addressed next, after which the control toolchain and the experiments are presented.\n\n4.1 Driving Simulation\n\nThe motivation for using driving simulators in this study is that they can offer the possibility to experiment with driving scenarios that are difficult, and costly, to create in a real environment. For example, factors that make real-world experiments prohibitive are: access to vehicles and needed hardware, ensuring tests are safe, needing to perform system identification or measure relevant parameters, setting up prototype autonomous driving systems, the time to set up and conduct experiments, and also the difficulty of setting up controlled experiments when relevant variables cannot be controlled. With driving simulators, it is possible to work at a higher level of abstraction focusing more closely on the learning and safety systems at the functional level. The driving environment can be interfaced with system models as part of a software-in-the-loop or model-in-the-loop setup, which helps in evaluating functional safety.\n\nSpecifically for this vision-based speed control study, the elements needed in a driving simulator are the following.\n\n• off-line data export The quantities that are relevant to training need to be available for off-line use. These include: image frames, distance traveled by ego vehicle, distances to other vehicles of interest, acceleration and brake pedal positions, simulation time, as well as any other interesting information for training.\n\n• closed loop control To pursue control in a dynamic virtual world environment, there needs to be a possibility for using the above quantities in a closed loop setup where data is processed and control is sent to the vehicle during simulation. This can require synchronization between several simulation software components and user models.\n\n• adequate virtual world A basic level of scientific accuracy is needed in the simulation environment. This includes the physics of the vehicles within the environment, and also the visual appearance of virtual world.\n\nThree virtual driving simulators have been tried to assess their potential to support vision-based control studies: IPG CarMaker, TESIS DYNA4, and TASS PreScan. These simulators are discussed in the following subsections.\n\n4.1.1 IPG CarMaker\n\nCarMaker is a virtual testing platform for passenger cars and light-duty vehicles. The simulator can be interfaced with the MATLAB/Simulink environment using CarMaker's provided templates that include S-function blocks. The user's control strategies can be implemented either by manipulating Simulink signals or by creating custom modules. CarMaker can be run either stand-alone, or in cosimulation with Simulink.\n\nCarMaker offers possibilities for offline data export. After simulations, image frames can be obtained from the animation tool either by exporting video frames, or by exporting a video. However, timestamps are not available if the image frames are exported directly. The data plotting tool, IPG-Control, can be used for exporting simulation variables into a csv file. To capture data, IPGControl needs to be configured before simulations.\n\nExcept for a camera feed, all our needed quantities can be used directly in a closed loop setup within Simulink. IPG offers the Video Data Stream (VDS) extension package which allows sending video out of the animation tool via TCP, and includes some additional features for adding camera noise, motion blur, etc. This feature was not included in my initial trail, and had to be requested specifically. Using the additional visual features greatly reduces simulation and movie export speeds. Once a camera is configured within CarMaker, the animation tool, which is a separate program, sends out the video stream via TCP. After making several attempts to receive the video in Simulink using different approaches, at best the received images contained some distortions/artifacts, and the animation tool did not synchronize successfully with Simulink.\n\nAs for other factors, CarMaker meets the needs adequately with regards to scientific accuracy of the simulations and visual appearance of the virtual world.\n\n4.1.2 TESIS DYNAware DYNA4\n\nDYNA4 is simulation framework aimed at supporting vehicle development processes, and runs within Simulink, allowing for signals to be accessed and manipulated. Users can also configure and add new Simulink modules from within DYNA4.\n\nTo export data for offline use, one can select the needed quantities before the simulation, and then a mat file with needed variables is produced after its completion. DYNA4 stores the data needed to recreate the animation after simulations. Video can then be played back or exported, for any completed simulation.\n\nData signals are available for closed loop control, however, in the commercially available DYNA4 product camera pixels are not accessible in Simulink. TESIS kindly allowed me the opportunity to test a development version which includes this functionality. To obtain the camera feed for closed loop control, the camera is configured within DYNA4, and a receiver block is added to the corresponding Simulink model of the simulation project. A blocking communication is setup between the animation tool and Simulink, allowing for pixel data be accessed simply.\n\nDYNA4 offers a visually appealing animation which can support our vision-based control investigation, as well as an adequately accurate virtual world.\n\n4.1.3 TASS PreScan\n\nPrescan offers a simulation framework for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Intelligent Vehicle (IV) systems, targeted more for the simulation of sensors and the virtual environment, rather that vehicle dynamics. Simulink is also used as a simulation engine. After the scenario is configured in a GUI tool, a Simulink model is generated. ADAS functions can be implemented simply by modifying the generated models. Also, a wide variety of demos are provided featuring different ADAS functions, allowing for users to substitute their own algorithms. Sensor technologies such as radar, laser, camera, ultrasonic, GPS and C2C/C2I communications, are supported. A physics-based camera model is also available, which accounts for a complete pipeline from light sources to optics and final image.\n\nOne notable aspect with PreScan is its strong integration with MATLAB and Simulink, allowing for a lot of possibilities for accessing signals and controlling various elements of the virtual world, e.g. all simulation vehicles, pedestrians, sensors, and even lightposts. RGB pixels are also available conveniently in Simulink, facilitating camera-based ADAS function development. Furthermore, simulation runs can be automated with MATLAB scripts, which allows for performing tests with changed parameters and collecting results for processing, or exporting the data. Video can also be exported in different formates using a GUI visualization tool.\n\nSimple vehicle dynamics models are available in PreScan, which can be freely modified in Simulink. For more complex dynamics, PreScan allows for integration with other tools, such as CarSim and veDYNA.\n\n4.2 Vision to Speed Control\n\nSince the focus of this work is on learning systems in safety critical automotive applications, an example system is considered that controls the speed of the ego vehicle using camera images of the road. This study is delimited to longitudinal speed control, although a more comprehensive model was developed in Section 3.1.2.\n\nThe scenario consists of one leading vehicle fixed at some distance ahead of the ego vehicle. The task of the learning system is to detect the leading vehicle, and feed this information to a controller which then controls the gas and brake pedal positions. In such a setup, the output of the learning system can be readily compared to ground-truth for analysis.\n\nA deep neural network is used to detect the leading vehicle and provide bounding box information to be used for speed control. Since the distance to the leading vehicle is directly related to the bounding box size, a simple power-law function can be used to obtain a control signal, which then determines the gas and brake pedal positions.\n\nUsing such a setup where the learning system outputs intermediate bounding box information has some benefits:\n\n• This corresponds to a logical subproblem to the main speed control problem. If an end-to-end approach were used, the learning system would instead map pixel data to gas/brake pedal control. As discussed in Section 2.1, logical subsystems of end-to-end systems cannot be inspected, which allows a possibility for faults to be masked.\n\n• The ground truth is simple to determine, and depends only on images. In fact, the detector's performance can be assessed intuitively by viewing the resulting image sequence. For an end-to-end system, in contrast, the ground truth may depend on other factors such as the current speed and acceleration.\n\n• Since the scenario involves only one leading vehicle, the bounding box is sufficient information for a control strategy.\n\n• Many pretrained object detectors are available, allowing for the possibility of experimenting with existing state of the art networks.\n\nThe function of the learning system in this study is to identify the leading vehicle in camera images containing the road, environment, scenery and other traffic objects. For such a problem, object localization as well as classification are needed. One interesting approach is to use a region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN), which includes a region proposal network and an object classification network. A recent advancement in using this architecture is the Faster R-CNN [23, 24], where the classification network shares full-image convolutional features with the region proposal network, which enables nearly cost-free region proposals. The experiments presented in the following section employ a Faster R-CNN trained for localizing and classifying the leading vehicle.\n\n4.3 Experiments\n\nThe experimental setup considered consists of an empty stretch of road with one fixed vehicle located some distance ahead of the ego vehicle. A camera is placed behind the front windshield of the ego vehicle, and a Faster R-CNN system processes the images in order to control the speed. This simple experimental setup allows for testing only frontal collision avoidance. Extensions could be made in order to study more comprehensive scenarios, especially where the safety strategies are complex. However, this was not attempted in this experiment. More complex monitoring scenarios would help to test safety monitors, but contribute little to a safety investigation of the fundamental concerns with learning systems.\n\nThe strategy computed for the SMOF safety monitor in the longitudinal case (see Section 3.1.1) was to trigger a braking intervention when the warning region is in an approach state. This occurs as soon as when the distance to the leading vehicle becomes less than the safe distance. A key point is that the safety monitor can trigger interventions, rather than passively monitor, or only block actions, and technical specifications of interventions and region boundaries allow for guaranteeing collision avoidance if the specifications hold. The monitor calculates the safe distance dynamically based on the ego vehicle's current speed and the relative acceleration, using the approach presented in Section 3.2. Since in this simplified setup the leading vehicle is stationary, only the ego vehicle's deceleration curve is needed in the calculation.\n\nFigure 12 shows a block diagram of the control setup used for experiments. Camera images are used to control the speed of the ego vehicle, with a safety monitor installed to intervene when a warning state is reached. Ground truth information is used for safety monitoring, as this avoids introducing additional points of failure extraneous to the learning system under study.\n\nFigure 12: Control loop with safety monitoring\n\nThe goals for experiments are twofold: firstly to simulate the safety monitoring and vision-based control toolchains and demonstrate collision avoidance in cases of hazardous speed control; and secondly to discuss an example trustworthiness indicator for the learning system, which can help warn in advance before severe safety interventions are needed. This is related to the Safe Fail strategy mentioned in Section 2, in which the system does not attempt to offer an output in case of low confidence, or closeness to the decision boundary, and the operator makes the decision instead. However, in the speed control context, it is not possible to expect for the driver to immediately take over. The trustworthiness indication approach in this thesis allows for the driver to be warned regarding the learning system in a low confidence scenario.\n\n4.3.1 Design of Experiments\n\nThe Neural Network Toolbox in MATLAB 2017a offers an implementation of the Faster R-CNN deep learning system, including a class object and a function to train the detector. Although code from the Faster R-CNN authors is publicly available [23, 24], The implementation in the toolbox was opted for, due to ease of use and possibly quicker development time. Flexibility in regard to tweaking and tailoring algorithms for better performance is not a primary goal for this project.\n\nThe virtual world contains a straight stretch of road with some trees along the sides, and one vehicle fixed 300m ahead of the ego vehicle. The only variable that affects the camera images is the ego vehicle's position along the road. Therefore, by simply passing the camera along the road it is possible to capture images at any needed distance resolution.\n\nThis scenario avoids needing to perform image processing online. Image processing and driving simulation are computationally expensive tasks. At the time of conducting the work for this thesis, an adequate computational setup was not yet available, and the available GPU was not supported by MATLAB. This greatly limits the achievable frame rate as the detector is run on CPU instead. For 500x375 images, the detector computes at around 0.15 fps on the available machine, rather than 5 fps in the Faster R-CNN author's papers. For a closed loop setup, the detector would need to run in Simulink as an extrinsic function, since code generation for the Faster R-CNN object detector class is not supported in Simulink. The 0.15 fps would therefore not be improved. In addition, driving simulators are also computational expensive which further limits the speed. A closed-loop setup with such computational limitations would hinder the prototyping and evaluation of systems.\n\nOn the other hand, if a more complex scenario with moving objects were used, the camera images would depend on several variables that would be difficult to control, necessitating a closed-loop setup. As online image processing is not pursued, any of the previously mentioned virtual vehicle simulators could be used: IPG CarMaker, TESIS DYNA4, and TASS PreScan. CarMaker was selected primarily because it was made available before the other two. PreScan, along with a suitable computer setup for simulation was available only after completing the work for this thesis. The test vehicle chosen is the demo Tesla S model example provided in CarMaker, which uses an electrical powertrain, and a camera was added behind the front windshield.\n\nThe ego vehicle was passed along the road at low speed and the frontal camera's video stream was exported, and then processed to produce images at 0.1m resolution. These images are used for training and testing, as well as to precompute detections at 0.1m intervals along the road for access during simulations. The labeling process requires manually drawing the bounding box of the leading vehicle in each image. This process was automated with the help of the MATLAB Ground Truth Labeler app, which can interpolate between manually made labels at key frames.\n\nDue to computational limitations, small 128x228 images were used. Training of a Faster R-CNN is a four step process. In the first step, the region proposal network (RPN) is trained. In the second, a separate detection network is trained using the proposals from step 1 RPN. In the third step, the detector is used to initialize the RPN, but only the layers unique to the RPN are trained. Finally in the fourth step, the layers unique to the detector are trained. One problem that occurred frequently in my training attempts is that no positive or negative samples may be found in the fourth step, when the proposals from the third step are used. At far distances from the leading vehicle, less pixels are used to represent the vehicle, which presents a challenge in training. The training process could complete only if far distances are excluded.\n\nThe leading vehicle is 300m ahead along the road. Detectors for two different distance ranges were investigated:\n\n1. A detector was trained for the distance ranges 250-270m and 280-295m, using 351 training images.\n\n2. A detector was trained for the distance range 270-295m, using 251 training images.\n\n4.3.2 Safety Monitoring\n\nFor calculating the safety distance dynamically at run time, the deceleration curve of the ego vehicle, and the expected acceleration curve of the leading vehicle are needed. Modeling the behavior of the leading vehicle for collision avoidance scenarios is an interesting topic for dedicated research. Discussed in [22] is the concept of decision functions, in which dynamic models of the two vehicles and the expectation of their future actions are used as the basis for decisions. The scenario in this simple study uses a stationary leading vehicle, and the safety monitor is designed based on this operating condition. Also, the braking curve can vary with different road conditions. In this study, the effect of different road conditions is not investigated, and could be also a topic for further work.\n\nTo determine the braking curve of the Tesla demo vehicle model, braking tests were performed on the same road to be used in the experiments. Figure 13 shows the braking behavior for different starting speeds until the vehicle is stopped. It takes approximately 1.5 seconds to reach maximum deceleration, which continues until the vehicle is almost stopped. As shown in the figure, this initial phase is the same regardless of the starting speed. Inspecting the distance traveled in the final phase when going back to zero acceleration shows that it is only a few centimeters (2-4 cm). For safety monitoring, only the initial phase and the maximum deceleration phase will be used in safety distance calculation.\n\nFigure 13: Braking deceleration for CarMaker test vehicle\n\n4.3.3 Control System\n\nThe speed of the ego vehicle is controlled via the gas and brake pedal position signals in the CarMaker Simulink model. The Faster R-CNN system outputs bounding boxes (this locates the object within the image) and corresponding scores of detected objects classified as the leading vehicle. The area of the highest scoring bounding box is used as an indirect indicator of the leading vehicle's distance. This applies since the vehicles are configured to be in the same lane. The control law then used to obtain an intermediate signal is in the following form\n\nu = Aα\n\nwhere A is the bounding box area (width × height pixels) divided by the image area, and α is a tunable parameter that affect the cautiousness of the resulting control. The resulting signal u takes values from the 0-1 range. The gas and brake pedal positions can be derived from u according to:\n\nbrake =\n\n{\n\n2 (u− 0.5) u > 0.5\n\n0 u ≤ 0.5\n\ngas =\n\n{\n\n−2 (u− 0.5) u < 0.5\n\n0 u ≥ 0.5\n\nwhich results in braking with no gas when u is larger than 0.5, and gas with no brakes otherwise. Both gas and brake pedals are not engaged when u = 0.5.\n\nThis control strategy is implemented in Simulink as shown in Figure 14, with also a moving average included to smooth out u. This is helpful especially for malfunctioning detector behavior with momentary object appearance or disappearance. The window size used is 200 samples. The simulation is configured for variable step size in the CarMaker Simulink interface, but inspection shows that 200 samples correspond to about 0.2 seconds of simulation time.\n\nFigure 14: Simulink control system for brake and gas pedal\n\nSimulations were performed using ground truth bounding box information in order to calibrate the α parameter, and a suitable value found was 0.1. Figure 15 shows the resulting vehicle speed and the corresponding control signals. The vehicle was initialized at 100km/hour (ca. 27.8m/s). Figure 16 shows the distance trajectory, with the accident distance marked.\n\nFigure 15: Speed control for α = 0.1, and ground truth detections.\n\nFigure 16: Distance curve for α = 0.1, and ground truth detections.\n\n4.3.4 Evaluation Metrics\n\nTwo detectors for different distance ranges will be tested. The training difficulties were previously noted with regard to far distances, and training had to be restricted to closer distances for it to succeed. The first detector was trained for 250-270 and 280-295m, using 351 training images. Training did not yield good performance even within this training set, but this presents an interesting case for safety studies, as will be discussed. The second detector was trained for the easier 270-295m, using 251 training images. Much better performance could be achieved for this case within the training range, but this limited range helps to illustrate how a learning system can perform well for some data that was represented in the training, but cause hazardous behavior with unseen data.\n\nThe metric we will use for evaluating the performance of the learning system is the Intersection over Union (IoU) which is defined as IoU(A,B) =\n\narea(A ∩B) area(A ∪B)\n\nwhere A and B are the ground truth and detector bounding boxes. When multiple detections are produced by the detector, the highest scoring detection is used. The IoU does not distinguish between false positives and false negatives, but is a common metric for evaluating detectors and is sufficient given that false positives would trigger unwarranted braking.\n\nAnother measure that is of interest in this research is related to the similarity/dissimilarity of incoming camera images with the training images. Since the network is trained entirely using synthetic data from CarMaker, the influence of the training data can be controlled and accounted for. In addition, the random seed for the training process was fixed to insure reproducibility of the training results.\n\nAn example measure which utilizes SURF [25] features is used in these experiments. The SURF features of the highest scoring interest point in images are computed and used as descriptors. The disparity measure used in the experiments computes the Euclidean distance between the computed features of the runtime images to the nearest neighbor in the training set. SURF was chosen due to its speed advantages and scale invariance property. Other methods are not investigated in this study, but could be a topic for further research.\n\n4.3.5 First Detector\n\nThis detector was trained with 351 128x228 images for 250-270, and 280-295m distances. As previously mentioned, the less pixels used to represent the vehicle, the more difficult is the learning task. Attempts at training with the full 0-300m distance range have failed, and hence training was focused on closer distances where the leading vehicle is larger in the image. This detector was trained for 25 epochs.\n\nFigure 17 shows the IoU and disparity for the first detector, with the two distance ranges shaded. The measurements were filtered using a moving average of the same length as the moving average used for u, and 1 standard deviation curves are also plotted. The disparity is zero within the training intervals, as the incoming data was represented in the training set. On the other hand, distances away from the training intervals yielded high disparity, which decreases closer to the intervals. Ideally, the disparity measure should vary smoothly with distance, but this was seen not to be the case with using SURF features of a single interest point. Nonetheless, the metric helps to demonstrate that a disparity measure can be used to judge how well new data was represented in training. The detections were completely erroneous in the first trained interval, 250-270, as indicated by the IoU, while some detection capability is seen in the second trained interval 280-295.\n\nFigure 17: IoU and disparity mean and ± 1 standard deviation curves for the poor performing first detector. Notice low disparity close to and between training ranges.\n\nFigure 18 shows the trajectory of the ego vehicle along the road. An intervention was triggered, which successfully brought the vehicle to a halt before colliding with the leading vehicle.\n\nFigure 18: Distance trajectory along the road for the first detector, with braking intervention triggered\n\nThe speed control is shown in Figure 19, with the vehicle initialized at the start of the road with 0km/hour. A false positives period (vehicle detected as at close distance when it is actually farther away) caused braking starting at around 4 seconds. This is followed by a period where the detector is making some detections which are not accurate, as indicated by IoU in Figure 17. Afterwards, false negatives (vehicle detected as far away when it is actually near) caused an approach with high speed, which necessitates an intervention well before the trained intervals are encountered. In fact, the controller requested braking only towards the end of simulation when a good IoU is obtained.\n\nFigure 19: Speed control for the first detector. Dashed lines indicate overridden signal. False +ives indicate detecting a very near vehicle when it is in fact farther away, while false -ives indicate that the vehicle is detected as far away when it is in fact near.\n\n4.3.6 Second Detector\n\nIn light of the poor performance of the first detector, especially in its first trained distance range, a second attempt was made to train another detector with closer distances, making the learning task less difficult. The distance range was limited to 270-295m, and a detector was trained for 25 epochs with 251 training images.\n\nTraining indicated some success in learning within the trained distances. Two experiments are performed to illustrate both non-malfunctioning behavior where safety interventions are not required, and malfunctioning behavior that triggers the monitor interventions. In a low speed experiment, the needed safety distance does not exceed the trained range, which allows the controller an opportunity to operate within the learning system's trained distance range. Another experiment with higher approach speed was then performed, and a monitor intervention was necessary, since the learning system malfunctioned outside its trained distance range.\n\nLow speed experiment\n\nFor this experiment, the setup is initialized such that the learning system is allowed an opportunity to function within its trained distance range. Approaching at 70km/h would trigger an intervention at the start of the trained distance range, precluding the possibility of observing the controller's performance. The detector was seen to suffer from a false positives problem that brings the vehicle to a halt prematurely if initialized at the start of the road. To address these problems, the vehicle was initialized at 250m along the road with 35km/h.\n\nFigure 20 shows the IoU and disparity for the second detector. The measurements were filtered as before with detector 1 with the same moving average, and ±1 standard deviation curves are plotted. As indicated by the IoU, much better performance is attained within the learned distance range. The disparity is zero within the training intervals, as before, and is higher away from the trained data. The trend in disparity tends to be inversely related to the IoU performance measure.\n\nFigure 20: IoU and disparity mean and ± 1 standard deviation curves for the second detector low speed experiment.\n\nFigure 21 shows the trajectory of the ego vehicle along the road. An intervention was not required, as the controller successfully brought the vehicle to a halt before colliding with the obstacle.\n\nFigure 21: Distance trajectory along the road for the second detector low speed experiment, with braking intervention not triggered\n\nFigure 22 shows the speed control of the vehicle, initialized at the start of the road with 35km/hour. Light braking was requested initially in an untrained distance before 1.5s. Notice that this coincides with the IoU peak in Figure 20. Afterwards, braking was revoked and the gas pedal was increased briefly. Breaking is triggered again after the trained distance range is reached, stopping the vehicle before a collision.\n\nFigure 22: Speed control for the second detector low speed experiment.\n\nHigh speed experiment\n\nIn the high speed experiment with the second detector, the vehicle is instead initialized at 150m along the road, with 120km/h. At this speed, the needed safety distance is beyond the learning system's trained range. If the control fails to adequately brake prior to reaching the trained range, then a safety intervention would be needed.\n\nFigure 23 shows the filtered IoU and disparity curves in this experiment. The same trend is observed as previously in the other experiments, where the IoU performance tends to be inversely related to the run-time calculated disparity.\n\nFigure 23: IoU and disparity mean and ±1 standard deviation curves for the second detector high speed experiment.\n\nFigure 24 shows the trajectory of the ego vehicle along the road. As for the previous experiment with the first detector seen in Section 4.3.5, an intervention was triggered, which successfully stopped the vehicle and avoided the collision.\n\nFigure 24: Distance trajectory along the road for the second detector high speed experiment, with braking intervention triggered\n\nFigure 25 shows the speed control of the vehicle. Due to false positives (vehicle detected as at close distance when it is actually farther away), strong braking was activated before 1s. During this period zero IoU coupled with disparity peaks are observed in Figure 23. Shortly afterwards, false negatives (vehicle detected as far away when it is actually near) are obtained, which cause unsafe acceleration requiring an intervention. The controller continues to request acceleration until just before 4s where we have previously observed diminishing disparity. However, unlike for the low speed experiment, the controller requested braking too late and was already overridden by the safety monitor.\n\nFigure 25: Speed control for the second detector high speed experiment.\n\n4.4 Findings\n\nIn the experiments, the SMOF architecture has been used along with dynamic safety distances. The braking intervention was triggered at the right moments to prevent an accident, which resulted in the ego vehicle stopping only a few meters from collision. In addition, an example indicator for the learning system's trustworthiness has been demonstrated.\n\nThe disparity measure in the experiments tended to be inversely related to the learning system's performance, which is expected as performance should be better with data similar to the training set. This also suggests a potential for runtime trustworthiness indication using a disparity approach. Further research could investigate the development of better indicators and the desirable properties they should possess. For example, the disparity indicator used the features of only the highest scoring SURF interest point. In theory, SURF interest points are scale invariant and should not greatly fluctuate as the ego vehicle approaches the other vehicle. However, some fluctuations were observed in the experiments. Brief inspections showed that, for some distances, the highest scoring interest point can change abruptly for minor variation in scale. It could help to investigate combining several interest points, but this would increase the computational demand. Also, SURF operates on gray-scale images. This overlooks possibly essential color information that can affect the performance of the learning system. Other approaches can be tested that incorporate spatial as well as color features of images.\n\nof images.\n\nThe motivation behind the disparity measure is to obtain a reliable trustworthiness metric that can be computed at run time for incoming data in order to indicate the performance of the learning system. The best ways to utilize this trustworthiness indication could also be a topic for further research. Using it within a safety monitor would yield a more complex monitor, and present challenges with verification or certification. However, such trustworthiness metric can be of help in alerting the driver before a safety monitor intervention is required. Safety interventions can be unpleasant for the driver, as is the case with the full force braking used in the experiments.\n\n5 Discussion\n\nThis section discusses and summarizes the thesis, and points to possible directions for further work.\n\nThe safety concerns with learning systems were discussed in Section 2. Several concerns emerge from the loss functions and the training data used for developing learning systems. When using quantities such as average prediction error, loss functions may not account for the human cost that is relevant for safety. The training samples may not correctly reflect the scenario that was aimed for, and may inadequately represent rare cases that are highly relevant for safety. Learning systems were discussed for autonomous driving, with particular focus on end-to-end systems. The end-to-end paradigm, discussed in Section 2.1 is an extremely capable approach where complex learning problems are solved implicitly by the systems, without the need to identify and address the logical subproblems. From a safety viewpoint, this compounds the challenges associated with obtaining adequate training data, due to possible fault masking effects. Following a discussion of some relevant sections of the ISO 26262, a promising approach was indicated for meeting safety goals, which involve introducing separate architectural elements that are more amenable to meeting stringent safety requirements, while the learning systems themselves can be exempt from needing to comply with the standard. It was discussed also that verifying properties of learning systems at the technical/mathematical level may not be of help in autonomous driving applications, as that would involve specifying properties of input pixel values and output quantities. Instead, a safety monitoring approach was motivated.\n\nSafety monitoring was discussed in Section 2.3. Formal methods and model checking are useful tools in the design of safety monitors. However, important to consider is the state space explosion problem that can limit the scalability of model checkers. The SMOF safety monitoring approach was found particularly interesting, due to the possibility for monitors that implement interventions, rather than only inhibitions, and the possibility of automatically generating safety strategies. This approach has been applied to a longitudinal collision avoidance scenario, and also a scenario targeting combined longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance. Technical implementation aspects of interventions were also discussed, and an approach was presented for calculating region boundaries using time-varying acceleration models.\n\nA case study was presented in Section 4, involving the use of a learning system to control the vehicle's speed using camera pixel data. The use of simulations for supporting this study was discussed, with important considerations being functionalities for off-line data export, closed loop control, and an adequate virtual world accuracy. Three simulation tools were tried: IPG CarMaker, TESIS DY-NAware, and TASS PreScan. CarMaker was not found to support a vision-based closed loop control setup, but was nonetheless used due to its earlier availability, and challenges with computational resources and time that anyway preclude online closed loop control. A simple scenario was pursued, for which offline processing helps in avoiding the online processing needed in a closed loop setup. Experiments were built within a simulation environment for frontal collision avoidance, including safety monitoring and control toolchains. The SMOF architecture was used, and interventions were triggered following dangerous malfunctioning behavior in the learning system. Finally, also an indicator was presented for the trustworthiness of the learning system during operation.\n\nFurther work could investigate simulations with more complex safety monitoring scenarios, beyond the frontal collision avoidance tested in this thesis. In implementing safety interventions with the approach presented in this thesis, an essential information is the expected future trajectory of the object. This was not studied, and the object was simply assumed to be stationary in the experiments.\n\nThis topic can be investigated in a further work. If the solution is probabilistic, that would present an interesting concern with regard to determinism in safety monitoring. Finally, a simple example was offered in this thesis to illustrate trustworthiness indication, and little effort was aimed at developing a good performing metric. This topic could be further investigated, including the application of such indicator within safety systems. It is important in particular that computation is feasible online.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] \"Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems,\" Standard SAE J3016, Society of Automotive Engineers, 2016.\n\n[2] P.

Similarity Matching in Computer Vision and Multimedia.\n\nA Safety Distance for Time-Varying Acceleration\n\nConsider that two objects are moving towards each other with relative acceleration a(t) > 0, given an initial relative speed v0, which reaches 0 at the time of collision. The minimal initial separation x0 that avoids a trajectory reaching 0 distance needs to be found.\n\nRelative acceleration is the sum of the ego vehicle's and the object's accelerations towards each other, a(t) = as(t) + ai(t). Assume a conservative estimate of the object's predicted worst-case acceleration âi(t) during the intervention time window, and a conservative estimate of the ego vehicle's ability to counteract the acceleration âs. Let the worst case evolution of relative acceleration be â(t) = âs(t) + âi(t). The task is to obtain the initial separation x0 that avoids a trajectory reaching 0 distance.\n\nThe equivalent force causing relative acceleration â(t) can be expressed as F = m1â(t) +m2â(t)\n\n= (m1 +m2) dv(t)\n\ndt\n\n.\n\nWork done by this force resulting in a small movement dx is given by dw = Fdx\n\n= (m1 +m2) dv\n\ndt dx\n\n= (m1 +m2) dx\n\ndt dv = (m1 +m2)vdv\n\nThe amount of work done to cause a loss of the initial speed v0 can be found using\n\nW =\n\n∫ 0\n\nv0\n\n(m1 +m2)vdv\n\n= −1\n\n(m1 +m2)v2\n\n2 0\n\nwith the negative indicating work done in the opposite direction to the direction of increasing velocity.\n\nIf this amount of work is done by F , then the relative speed between the objects goes to zero when they collide. We need ∫ 0\n\nx0\n\nFdx = −1\n\n(m1 +m2)v2\n\n2 0∫ 0\n\nx0\n\n(m1 +m2)a(t)dx = − (m1 +m2)v\n\n1 2\n\n2 0\n\n∴\n\n∫ 0\n\nx0\n\nâ(t)dx = −1 2\n\nv20\n\nThis gives a relation between initial velocity and required separation under time-varying acceleration.\n\n52\n\n53\n\nTRITA MMK 2017: 149 MES 015\n\nwww.kth.se",

Applikationsområden inkluderar mönsterigenkänning, datorseende, tal‐ och språkförståelse. När utvecklingen inom bilindustrin går mot en ökad grad av automatisering, blir problemen som måste lösas alltmer komplexa, vilket har lett till ett ökat användande av metoder från maskininlärning och deep learning. Med detta tillvägagångssätt lär sig systemet lösningen till ett problem implicit från träningsdata och man kan inte direkt utvärdera lösningens korrekthet. Detta innebär problem när systemet i fråga är del av en säkerhetskritisk funktion, vilket är fallet för självkörande fordon. Detta examensarbete behandlar säkerhetsaspekter relaterade till maskininlärningssystem i autonoma fordon och applicerar en safety monitoring‐metodik på en kollisionsundvikningsfunktion. Simuleringar utförs, med ett deep learning‐system som del av systemet för perception, som ger underlag för styrningen av fordonet, samt en safety monitor för kollisionsundvikning. De relaterade operationella situationerna och säkerhetsvillkoren studeras för en autonom körnings‐funktion, där potentiella fel i det lärande systemet introduceras och utvärderas. Vidare introduceras ett förslag på ett mått på trovärdighet hos det lärande systemet under drift. </p><h4><p> ii </p></h4><p> </p><h4><p> iii </p></h4><p> Master of Science Thesis MMK 2017:149 MES 015 </p><p>Safety of Machine Learning Systems in Autonomous Driving </p><p> </p><h4><p> Fadi Al-Khoury </p></h4><p>Approved </p><p>Examiner </p><h4><p>Martin Törngren</p></h4><p> </p><p>Supervisor </p><h4><p>De-Jiu Chen</p></h4><p> </p><p> Commissioner </p><p>Contact person </p><h2><p>Abstract </p></h2><p>Machine Learning, and in particular Deep Learning, are extremely capable tools for solving problems which are difficult, or intractable to tackle analytically. Application areas include pattern recognition, computer vision, speech and natural language processing. With the automotive industry aiming for increasing amount of automation in driving, the problems to solve become increasingly complex, which appeals to the use of supervised learning methods from Machine Learning and Deep Learning. With this approach, solutions to the problems are learned implicitly from training data, and inspecting their correctness is not possible directly. This presents concerns when the resulting systems are used to support safety-critical functions, as is the case with autonomous driving of automotive vehicles. This thesis studies the safety concerns related to learning systems within autonomous driving and applies a safety monitoring approach to a collision avoidance scenario. Experiments are performed using a simulated environment, with a deep learning system supporting perception for vehicle control, and a safety monitor for collision avoidance. The related operational situations and safety constraints are studied for an autonomous driving function, with potential faults in the learning system introduced and examined. Also, an example is considered for a measure that indicates trustworthiness of the learning system during operation. </p><h4><p> iv </p></h4><p> </p><h4><p> v </p></h4><h2><p>Acknowledgements </p></h2><p>I would like to thank all the people who contributed in some way to this thesis project.

Automation systems are needed to deliver important functions that can be safety critical. Safety concerns become more difficult to tackle when the solutions to complex automation problems emerge from deep learning or machine learning, and involve elements that are non deterministic, and difficult to inspect for correctness. The research questions are formulated in this section, along with the corresponding delimitations. An outline of the thesis is then presented, followed by a list of contributions.\n</p><p>Automation is expected to continue to take on important functions in various products and services used by society. In safety-critical applications, faults in automation can have great consequences such as loss of life, damage to property, and financial losses. The safety of such systems needs to be assured with good confidence. The focus of this thesis is particularly on automation within autonomous driving. The SAE J3016 standard [1] describes five levels of driving automation, ranging from basic driver assistance in level 1, to full automation under all driving situations in level 5. The commercially available technology is currently at level 2, and higher levels are being developed. Audi has recently announced its A8 model for 2018 featuring level 3 automation [2]. With level 3, automated systems control the vehicle and monitor the environment under some driving modes, but a human driver is expected to intervene when requested as a fall-back measure.\n</p><p>Embedded systems are essential to many automation functionalities in autonomous vehicles. Several definitions exist for embedded systems, and more commonly relate to hardware and software aspects. For example, [3] offers a concise definition where \"Embedded systems are systems which include a computer but are not used for general purpose computing.\" From a systems engineering perspective, a definition that can be suitable for the context of functional safety in autonomous driving is that an embedded system is \"a system that is part of a larger system and performs some special purpose for that system (in contrast to a general-purpose part that is meant to be continuously configured to meet the demands of its users)\" [4]. Common in applications with embedded systems is the requirement for real-time interaction with the world. Several subjects areas assist in the systematic design of embedded systems for safety: safety engineering, systems engineering, formal methods, and software testing.\n</p><p>Apart from safety, also several ethical and legal matters need to be considered when driving decisions are provided by algorithms. An interesting dilemma is discussed in [5] regarding how an algorithm should choose between two evils. This includes cases such as whether the algorithm should decide to sacrifice the vehicle's passengers in order to save a greater number of other people, or should it decide to protect the passengers at all cost. The answer to such a question depends on moral and philosophical viewpoints that vary across societies and individuals. A new General Data Protection Regulation, summarized in [6], is planned to be enforced across the EU in 2018. In this law, the user should be able to obtain an explanation regarding an algorithmic decision made on his/her behalf.\n</p><p>Several technologies are employed in the automotive industry and academia for monitoring the vehicle's environment, which include cameras, Radar, Lidar, and ultra-sonic sensors. The sensor data is fed to algorithms that support various functionalities, which may be of high relevance to safety. These algorithms may also be highly complex, making them difficult to analyze. The problem associated with using the sensor data for achieving the required functions is not possible to solve analytically for real world scenarios due to large input spaces (e.g. all combinations of pixel values). For such problems, solutions have emerged from the fields of Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and\nstatistical signal processing. These approaches share a probabilistic paradigm. Depending on the method used, the probabilistic factors may or may not need to be explicitly treated when solving the problem. The answers are for some methods described in terms of probability distributions, while for other methods probabilistic factors affect the solution implicitly and are not indicated in the answers. This is especially the case with deep learning, where labeled data is used to train an artificial neural network to solve the problem. This thesis refers to systems utilizing probabilistic methods from these three fields as Learning Systems, and focuses explicitly on methods using supervised learning with labeled data used for training or statistical analysis.\n</p><p>When automation is used to drive the vehicle, there are several possible points of failure in the system. These include hardware and software malfunction, problems with network delays/synchronization, mechanical problems, and also the behavior of the learning systems used. Investigating the safety impacts of these elements in the real world for autonomous driving can be infeasible and also dangerous. This motivates alternative methods that instead involve the use of simulations. Of relevance also is the ISO 26262 [7] standard, which covers functional safety for electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems in passenger vehicles, including software. This thesis focuses on the safety concerns with using learning systems in autonomous driving. The next section introduces the research questions that will be addressed.\n</p><h4><p>1.1 Research Questions\n</p></h4><p>The research questions investigated in this thesis are stated as follows:\n</p><p>1. What are the concerns when learning systems are used in safety critical applications, specifically in the pursuit of higher levels of autonomous driving (SAE level 3 and higher)?\n</p><p>• Learning algorithms are affected by probabilistic factors inherent in their design. What are the concerns if we need to assure their safety in high-criticality automotive applications?\n</p><p>• What are the implications when we need to comply with ISO 26262, specifically with regard to clauses 7 and 8 of part 3, which address hazard analysis, risk assessment, and the functional safety concept?\n</p><p>2. Given the challenges with regards to safety-assurance of learning systems, what solutions can be considered?\n</p><p>• What are the prominent formal methods approaches, and how can we assess their suitability for different applications? For example: is it helpful to use methods that verify mathematical properties of inputs and outputs for the learning system, or is it more appropriate to introduce other architectural elements, such as safety monitors, that address behavioral/functional properties?\n</p><p>• Using an example deep learning system in a speed control application, how could we design a simple safety monitoring solution that is feasible for this scenario. Would the monitor design complexity present challenges?\n</p><p>3. Due to cost and safety considerations for prototyping autonomous speed control systems in a physical environment, how can simulations assist in testing safety monitors and learning systems? What are the needed elements in the simulator to support safety studies of vision based learning systems? What commercial tools can we identify and test for this setup?\n</p><h4><p>1.2 Delimitations\n</p></h4><p>Some delimitations were made in order to better address the main focus of this work, while others had to be imposed due to limited project time and resources. Below is a list of the delimitations.\n</p><p>• The aim in this project is to study safety concerns with (supervised) learning systems and how safety can be assured for an example automotive application. Designing a high performing learning system is not a primary objective, and could even defeat the purpose of our investigation. Beyond achieving basic performance for conducting experiments, optimizing performance can also use up excess project time, considering the limited computational resources available.\n</p><p>• A discussion is presented regarding clauses 7 and 8 of the ISO 26262 part 3, which relate to hazard analysis and functional safety at the concept phase. Other parts of the standard are not discussed unless there is a need to reference them. The focus is on studying safety for learning systems at a conceptual level rather than undertaking product development activities.\n</p><p>• Although a safety monitoring strategy is developed for the general scenario of combined longitudinal and lateral motion, only the simpler frontal collision avoidance monitoring is tested in simulations.\n</p><p>• The approach presented in this thesis uses a model of the leading vehicle's expected future trajectory in collision avoidance. However, this is not addressed in any depth, and only the case of a fixed leading vehicle is considered.\n</p><p>• Fault tolerance within the control system by incorporating sensor fusion using different types of sensors is not considered. Although the simplicity of the design presented in Section 4.2 could be criticized, the focus in this thesis is not on sensor solutions yielding high robustness and performance, but rather is on the fundamental safety challenges with learning systems, and handling faults at an architectural level.\n</p><p>• A prototype vision-based speed control system will be developed in later sections. Imperfections in the image data due to noise, distortions, motion blur, are not incorporated, as this introduces unneeded variables to the study, and also increases computational demands in preparing experiments. The main interest is in the fundamental safety concerns when deploying learning systems in safety critical applications. Noise or imperfect data is a problem that is not specific to learning systems. Also for safety monitoring, the focus is on the functionality assuming perfect input information.\n</p><p>• An example measure is discussed and tested as an indicator of the learning system's trustworthiness during operation. The development of better indicators, or the investigation of desired properties of such indicators has not been attempted in this work.\n</p><h4><p>1.3 Research Method\n</p></h4><p>To address the goals for this thesis, literature is examined on relevant topics and a demo is built in a simulation environment. Relevant literature is identified on learning systems, especially with regard to safety and how the problem can be defined in the context of safety. Also, the types of learning systems that are most relevant in autonomous driving are identified, along with particular safety concerns with their use. The ISO 26262 is consulted for a recommendation on how to meet safety goals given the challenges with assuring the safety of learning systems. Literature is also examined on formal methods, and how they can fit into safety assurance for autonomous driving, beginning\nwith the SMOF approach [8, 9] which is of interest at the Embedded Control Systems devision at KTH. The knowledge and experience gained is then demoed in a virtual vehicle simulation setup, and experiments are performed to further examine the safety concerns and seek insights.\n</p><h4><p>1.4 Thesis Outline\n</p></h4><p>This thesis studies the safety concerns with learning systems delivering critical functionalities in autonomous driving, and investigates an architectural approach for meeting safety requirements. This section introduces the topic of safety in the context of autonomous driving, and the use of learning systems in safety-critical applications. Section 2 discusses the safety concerns, as well as the use of learning systems for autonomous driving. This is followed by a discussion of the ISO 26262 standard and the architectural approach to addressing safety is considered. Section 2.3 reviews the literature on safety monitoring and identifies a promising approach. Section 3 applies the safety monitoring approach to the context of collision avoidance. A case study is presented in Section 4, in which simulation is used to support safety studies of safety monitoring and control. The control system considered uses camera images as input, and utilizes deep learning. An indicator is presented for the trustworthiness of the learning system during operation. Experiments are then performed to study safety and test collision avoidance. Finally, Section 5 discusses and summarizes the work in this thesis, and offers suggestions for further research.\n</p><h4><p>1.5 Contributions\n</p></h4><p>The contributions of this thesis are the following:\n</p><p>• A discussion is made of the safety concerns with deploying learning systems in safety critical automotive applications in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. Safety monitoring approaches are also discussed along with their complexity considerations in Section 2.3.\n</p><p>• Models for longitudinal as well as combined longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance scenarios are developed and used within a safety monitoring approach in Section 3.1.\n</p><p>• An approach to safety distance calculation based on time varying relative acceleration models is presented in Section 3.2. Constant acceleration models are shown to offer relatively optimistic safety distances in comparison, which is not desirable.\n</p><p>• The use of simulations for supporting safety studies of camera-based learning systems is discussed in Section 4.1, and three simulation tools, IPG CarMaker, TESIS DYNAware, and TASS PreScan are considered for this application.\n</p><p>• A simulation-based approach is presented in Section 4.3 for performing safety studies with camera-based vehicle control, where a full control and safety toolchain can be tested. Experiments with malfunctioning behaviors in a vision-based speed control system are also presented. An architectural safety monitoring approach is applied and demonstrated for collision avoidance in case of hazardous speed control behavior.\n</p><p>• An example runtime indicator is presented in Section 4.3.4, for the trustworthiness of a vision-based speed control system. Such an indicator can help warn in advance before severe safety interventions are needed.\n</p><h3><p>2 Background\n</p></h3><p>This section presents the background relevant to the discussions of this thesis. A function approximation view of learning systems is introduced and used to discuss safety concerns. Applications for learning systems in autonomous driving are then discussed, with particular mention of the end-to-end approach to solving automation problems, and the safety implications that arise. The ISO 26262 is discussed for this context, and an architectural approach to safety is considered. Safety monitoring is then introduced, and a promising approach in the literature is identified.\n</p><p>Although developments in automation may yield good performance, and even eliminate sources of human error, there are several sources of failures that introduce hazards. For the case where the automation systems employ learning algorithms, these sources can include unreliable sensors, problems with the data used for training, as well as limitations in the algorithms and faults in their design.\n</p><p>With regard to the learning systems addressed in this thesis, Vapnik [10] provides a definition that is helpful in this context. In Vapnik's paper, learning is posed as a problem of function approximation involving three components:\n</p><p>1. A generator of random vectors x, drawn independently from a fixed but unknown distribution P (x).\n</p><p>2. A supervisor which returns an output vector y to every input vector x, according to a conditional distribution function P (y|x), also fixed but unknown.\n</p><p>3. A learning machine capable of implementing a set of functions f(x,w), where w ∈W is a set of parameters to be learned.\n</p><p>To illustrate these components in an example application, consider the case where a deep neural network classifies input images. The generator would be the training images used to train the network, with each image being a vector x in Vapnik's model. The supervisor would be the ground truth labeling process for the training images, where the class label is encoded in the output vector y referred to above. A commonly used distinction in machine learning literature is between supervised and unsupervised learning. In the former, ground truth labels are available, as is the case in our image classification example. With unsupervised learning on the other hand, ground truth labels are not available and other mechanisms are used. A key point is that P (y|x) is unknown, and in effect sampled for available x vectors. Finally, the implementation of the particular deep neural network architecture would constitute the learning machine. The term w refers to the network parameters such as the weights and biases. The resulting output of the neural network, depends on the input image x, and the network parameters w used, which are determined by the training process. The concept of learning systems discussed in this thesis uses this function approximation view of supervised learning. A discussion is presented in [11, 12] on the critical role of training data and loss functions, which represent training objectives, for the safety of machine learning systems. For the loss functions, the authors note that with quantities related to performance or prediction error, the human cost that is relevant for safety may not be accounted for. For example, consider the trivial scenario where the steering angle for a vehicle is learned by a neural network from labeled data. The quantities relevant for safety may include the risk of collision, and the risk of injury or death, which depend on the operating environment. If the backpropagation method is used with the angle error alone, these\nsafety considerations are not incorporated in the loss function. Also, arguments based on laws of large numbers (e.g. average error) may not be suitable when considering safety, since safety-critical cases may be rare and underrepresented in an aggregate quantity. Two concerns are noted by the authors for the training data\n</p><p>• The training samples may not be drawn from the underlying distribution, P (y|x). For the image classification example, consider the case when the training images are produced by ideal sensors, and contain no noise, distortions, or motion blur, but the actual P (y|x) needed for the application is for non-ideal realistic images. By using ideal training images, the training samples were drawn from a different distribution than P (y|x). In addition, the difference between the target distribution and the distribution from which training samples are drawn may not be easily understood or possible to account for.\n</p><p>• The training samples are absent in parts of the x vector space. This can especially be the case for rare, low probability, x regions. Safety relevant rare conditions may be insufficiently represented, or not represented at all.\n</p><p>There may be other concerns the authors do not explicitly include, such as the formulation of the learning problem with adequate and suitable information to infer outputs. This can be viewed as sampling from P (y|z) when P (y|x) is the needed distribution for the problem. If the mapping between z and x is many-to-one, then simply extra training data would be needed. If the mapping is one-to-many, or many-to-many then nondeterminism is introduced, affecting the potential for inferring the output. Overfitting is another problem in supervised learning, which is related to the complexity of the learned system (e.g. the number of weights) relative to the amount of training data. A complex model can fit exactly a set of points that draw a straight line with an added noise, however, it will generalize very poorly on unseen data compared to a simple model for a straight line. This can be related to the discussion on the loss functions. When using only the error in the loss function, the complex model would be favored, however, an additional term can be incorporated to avoid overfitting by penalizing model complexity. This technique is known as regularization. Overfitting can also be related to causality and interpretability. The higher model complexity can allow for fitting noise and vagaries in the training data that are not part of the underlying physics, and also make the model more difficult to understand.\n</p><p>The authors suggest four strategies for improving safety:\n</p><p>• Inherently Safe Design Causality and interpretability can be insisted on in the design of systems, which allows for the behavior of the models in response to inputs to be understood and verified. Irrelevant input and output variables need to be eliminated, to expose the main \"physics\" of the system governing its functional and safety properties. Interpretability refers to the possibility of understanding the models and their operation, for e.g. whether a model is black box, gray box, white box, etc. Interpretable models can much more easily be examined with respect to safety or other properties. The authors, do not include causality as a safety concern beside the training data and loss functions above, but it can contribute an offset between the target and training data distributions. For example, consider the case discussed in the previous paragraph regarding sampling from P (y|z) when P (y|x) is the needed instead.\n</p><p>• Safety Reserves In [11, 12], this refers to optimizing not only with respect to the model parameters, but also with respect to uncertainties in training data. A practical example is not suggested, but the key is to consider the worst case outcome while varying uncertainties, whether due to training and test distribution mismatch or instantiation of the test set. It is also suggested to consider fairness and equitability, so that certain groups are not underrepresented for safety.\n</p><p>• Safe Fail With this strategy, the system may elect a reject option, in which it does not attempt to predict the output for the given input sample. For example, in regions that are too close to decision boundaries, or regions that correspond to rare input conditions, a safe fail would be to ask the human operator to intervene.\n</p><p>• Procedural Safeguards User experience design can help guide practitioners on how to correctly setup the machine learning system. This includes the training data set, evaluation procedures, and other elements. If automated design processes are performed by users who are not deeply knowledgeable of the systems and associated safety concerns, incorrect use can be a concern. Another procedural safeguard is to have the possibility of public audit of source code, so that potential problems can be discovered. Having the data source publicly available is also suggested by the authors.\n</p><p>The next section discusses some autonomous driving applications from the literature with regard to safety. Following this, the relevant safety standard for such applications is considered, and then the topic of safety monitoring is introduced.\n</p><h4><p>2.1 Safety Issues When Using Learning Systems for Autonomous Driving\n</p></h4><p>A pioneering work in this area is [13] from 1989, where a neural network computes the steering angle for a vehicle using camera and laser rangefinder inputs. This approach later came to be called end-to-end learning, since the algorithms are not hand designed. After the introduction of convolutional neural networks (CNN), end-to-end learning was utilized in a famous project by LeCun et al. [14], to drive a model truck on unknown open terrain while avoiding obstacles. More recently, advancements have been made in CNNs for vision tasks, which were driven by improvements in computational resources and network designs with more hidden layers. Networks with large amount of layers are referred to as \"deep\" networks in the literature, with the corresponding phrase \"deep learning\" also used. [15] used Deep CNN for end-to-end steering in lane and road following.\n</p><p>The main attraction with the end-to-end approach is that no domain expertise is required on how the system should solve the problem. Although some expertise would be required for selecting a suitable training data set and loss functions for the problem, the process for solving the problem is inferred implicitly from data.\n</p><p>Relating to the interpretability concept mentioned earlier, end-to-end systems can be viewed as uninterpretable, black box, computations. Consider that solving the main problem controlling a vehicle using vision information consists of several logical subproblems, such as: lane tracking, scene understanding, vehicle state awareness, coordinating with other vehicles, action policy, and others. The logic of how an end-to-end system solves the main problem is not understood, neither is the correctness of the solutions to each logical subproblem. This presents a safety concern in its own right, and compounds the previously mentioned challenges regarding adequate training data.\n</p><p>For safety, training data needs to cover rare cases that exercise all logical subsystems of an end-to-end system. To illustrate the challenge, consider a problem composed of two subproblems: PA and PB. Since with end-to-end systems the solutions to the subproblems are not inspected separately, faults in one subproblem may be masked in the aggregate system. Consider fault FA which affects the solution to PA. Due to a masking affect, this particular fault may not always be detected in the aggregate system. Rather than requiring simply that the training data accounts for FA, in an end-to-end system the data needs to exercise FA such that it is detectable in the aggregate system. The rarity of needed data could be much higher than if subproblems could be inspected separately. As the complexity of problems increases for end-to-end systems, it becomes increasingly harder to alleviate safety concerns associated with adequate training data.\n</p><p>Analytical methods for verification of properties of deep networks have been proposed in the literature [16, 17]. However, these methods use a mathematical view of the system's inputs and outputs, where one needs to specify safety properties concerning the values of input pixels and output quantities. Even if this could be achieved, the likely complex methods required for deriving such specifications would need verification efforts of their own.\n</p><p>Next, a brief discussion is presented of some relevant portions of the ISO 26262 safety standard, in relation to safety critical autonomous driving applications.\n</p><h4><p>2.2 The ISO 26262 Standard\n</p></h4><p>As the automotive industry aims at higher levels of automation, there is a trend of increasing complexity in the various software, hardware, and mechatronic systems deployed in vehicles. Due to the challenges in scaling the safety assurance with system complexity, as well as the critical application areas involved, safety becomes increasingly a major issue. The ISO 26262 [7] standard addresses the functional safety of electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems within road vehicles, which for example include systems for: driver assistance, propulsion, and vehicle dynamics control. Safety requirements can be at the technical or functional level. Technical safety requirements pertain to safety of systems at the technical implementation level, and can for example include: voltage limits, memory requirements, speed ranges, safety distances, reaction times, etc. Functional safety requirements, on the other hand is implementation-independent, and relates to a higher level of abstraction which addresses behaviors of systems in response to inputs. This can involve, for example: actuator actions, computational flow within software, and transitions across system states. For functional safety, the system as a whole needs to be considered, along with the environment in which it operates.\n</p><p>The aim in the ISO 26262 is to assure the absence of unreasonable risk due to hazards caused by malfunctioning behavior of E/E systems, including software. The standard provides an automotive safety lifecycle, with a framework for the elimination of hazards and minimizing residual risk. The Safety Integrity Level is an important concept in the standard, pertaining to the amount of rigor in safety requirements that would be suitable for the amount of risk involved. Also, requirements for validation of safety and for relations with suppliers are addressed in the ISO 26262.\n</p><p>An overview of the ISO 26262 is shown in Figure 1. For the safety studies of learning systems presented in this thesis, the clauses in the standard which are most relevant are clauses 7 and 8 of part 3, addressing hazard analysis and functional safety at the concept phase of product development. The focus of this work is on the fundamental concerns with the use of learning systems. Safety within management, product development, and production activities is not of direct relevance, and is hence not discussed.\n</p><p>Figure 1: ISO 26262 overview [7]. Copyright remains with ISO (used with permission).\n</p><p>2.2.1 Hazard analysis, risk assessment and ASIL determination\n</p><p>In the ISO 26262, the term \"item\" is used to refer to a system or array of systems that implements a function at the vehicle level, and to which the standard is applied. The item of interest in the investigations presented in this thesis can be defined as the autonomous driving function achieved via learning systems, without specifying any particular choice of learning systems, or the type of input and interfaces they involve. An example of such an item discussed in Section 4 is a speed control system using a deep neural network vision system. That item takes camera images of the road as input, and outputs brake and acceleration levels.\n</p><p>During hazard analysis and risk assessment the item is evaluated without internal safety mechanisms, with regard to its potential hazardous events (i.e. combinations of hazards and operational situations). Hazards that can result also from foreseeable misuse shall be analyzed. The hazards that can be triggered by malfunctions in the item are identified, and safety goals for the prevention or mitigation of the hazardous events are formulated.\n</p><p>The standard requires for hazards to be determined systematically. Some hazard analysis techniques mentioned in the standard are Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Hazardous events and their associated safety goals are assigned Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs), which are determined according to an assessment of the severity, probability of exposure, and controllability of the hazards. Figure 2 shows the classification classes for these factors.\n</p><p>Figure 2: ISO 26262 classification of hazardous events [7].\n</p><p>Exposure and controllability assessments use estimates for the probability of exposure to hazardous situations, and the probability of avoiding harm, respectively. For classes E1-E4 and C1-C3, the difference in probability from one class to the next is an order of magnitude. It has been suggested in [18] to avoid probabilistic assessments as they bring in subjectivity for assumptions and analyses about the system, and that ASIL assessment entails a tension between safety and business competitiveness considerations for manufacturers. The assignment of ASIL in the standard using the severity, exposure, and controllability classes is shown in Figure 3.\n</p><p>In the collision avoidance scenarios discussed in this thesis, the hazard represents a situation where the vehicle may collide with obstacles due to failures in control functionalities achieved via learning systems. The corresponding safety goal is to avoid colliding with obstacles due to malfunctioning vehicle control from learning systems. Collisions can lead to fatal injuries, which are not avoidable without safety measures. This requires severity class S3, and a controllability class C3 classifications. Exposure refers to the relative frequency of exposure to the possibility of the hazard occurring. For example, hazardous events related to airbags have low exposure since airbags rarely deploy, while hazardous events related to braking systems have high exposure as braking is relevant in many driving situations. For example, an omission failure or braking, is relevant and dangerous in many driving\nsituations - thus having high exposure. In the context of safety critical learning systems used in autonomous driving, the exposure is high when essential driving functions are automated. This would require an exposure classification of E4. The ASIL that results from these severity, exposure, and controllability classifications is an ASIL D. Furthermore, a challenge when using use a data-driven design process rather than analytic methods, is the presence of not only known unknown factors, but also unknown unknowns that are difficult to account for in probability assessment.\n</p><p>Figure 3: ASIL assignment in ISO 26262 [7]\n</p><p>The ISO 26262-9:2011, Clause 5, offers an opportunity to implement safety requirements by independent architectural elements, and assign a potentially lower ASIL to the decomposed safety requirements. This is referred to as ASIL decomposition. For learning systems whose safety is difficult to analyze and verify, it can be desirable to divert away safety compliance efforts to simpler architectural elements that achieve the safety goals. For the ASIL D safety goal of avoiding collisions due to learning systems' functions, Clause 5.4.10, allows a decomposition into one ASIL D(D) requirement and one QM(D) requirement. The class QM (quality management) denotes that complying with the standard is not required. The ASIL QM(D) can be assigned to the learning system responsible for the autonomous driving functions, while an ASIL D(D) requirement can be assigned to a dedicated safety monitor for which it is simpler to assure safety compliance.\n</p><p>2.2.2 Functional safety concept\n</p><p>Clause 8 of ISO 26262-3 addresses the functional safety concept, which involves the allocation of functional safety requirements to architectural elements of the item, or to external measures. With the safety goal of avoiding collisions stated earlier decomposed into one ASIL D(D) requirement and one QM(D) requirement, an architectural element can be introduced to satisfy the ASIL D(D) requirement, while the original learning system can be exempt from needing to comply with the standard. The ASIL D(D) safety requirement can simply be to avoid colliding with obstacles. The added architectural element for this requirement can be considered as a safety monitor or a collision avoidance system.\n</p><p>The exact definition for this system would vary with implementation and technology choices, including the type of sensors used and the available system outputs. ASIL decomposition helps to divert safety assurance efforts from the complex systems that employ learning systems. However, complexity in the safety monitoring device can also increase verification efforts and should be minimized.\n</p><p>In this thesis, safety is addressed not by attempting to verify the safety properties of learning systems, and not by employing strategies that foster safety within learning systems. Instead, the idea is for safety concerns to be diverted to a separate architectural component for achieving the needed safety goals, whose verification is much simpler. Safety monitoring is considered for applications where the learning system drives the vehicle. Only accidents associated with colliding with obstacles are addressed, for which case collision avoidance is of relevance, and safety monitoring should achieve this function.\n</p><h4><p>2.3 The Safety Monitoring Approach to Safety\n</p></h4><p>Safety monitoring is not a new paradigm, although other terms have also been used to describe the approach. An early work in this area is [19] from 1987, which shows a formal methods approach that generates a supervisor from a system model and a constraint model both expressed as automata. The supervisor issues inhibitions to prevent hazardous actions. An example offered is when two users should not simultaneously access a shared resource. The objective would be to inhibit transitions in order to satisfy synchronization requirements. The authors provide a formal approach to proving that the needed supervisor exists, and that the corresponding synthesis problem is solvable.\n</p><p>Automated tools have been developed for verifying properties of automata models, known as model checkers. Model checkers exhaustively check the reachable states of the model. If the property holds, the model checker confirms it with full certainty, and provides some diagnostic information otherwise. Model checking has been used in the design of safety monitors. Siminiceanu and Ciardo [20] use their SMART model checker to verify the design and expose potential problems with the NASA airport runway safety monitor, which detects incursions and alert pilots.\n</p><p>With increasing complexity in system behavior and its environment, more descriptive models become needed, and their state space size increases. This presents a scalability challenge when using model checkers, since all the reachable states need to be checked. This is referred to as the \"state space explosion\" problem. In [20], the popular NuSMV and SPIN model checkers were found not feasible for the runway safety monitoring application with a large state space.\n</p><p>One other consideration is that embedded systems exhibit both event-driven and time-driven phenomena. To represent such systems, hybrid models are used which include both discrete and continuous variables. Model checkers for hybrid systems exist, notably [21], however the computational complexity in model checking hybrid models is larger than for discrete models, which present further scalability difficulties. In applications where an implicitly discrete view of time and other continuous variables is used (e.g. due to sampling and quantization), it can be suitable to use discrete models.\n</p><p>Runtime verification is another paradigm related to model checking. Rather than using a model checker to verify the safety monitor offline, the safety monitor checks the execution of the system online. In effect, not all possible system executions are exhaustively checked, but only those that are encountered during system operation. This provides a fault detection mechanism. A key difference with model checking is that no model for the system is needed. A runtime verification architecture is proposed in [3] for safety-critical embedded systems. In this approach, execution traces are analyzed during system operation and checked against formal specifications. A separate controller is then triggered if a violation occurs. The focus of this work is more on the technical level, relating to the technical operation of systems. An example offered by the author is the following: \"If the brake pedal has been pressed, then within 200ms cruise control should be disengaged for 100ms.\"\n</p><p>For collision avoidance, the top level safety goal is at the functional level, relating to the behavior of the vehicle within its environment. For complex scenarios, model checking can help ensure that this goal is achieved by the safety monitor, also if using runtime verification.\n</p><p>The work presented in this thesis will use the SMOF safety monitoring framework where the supervisor issues interventions, following [8, 9]. In this SMOF approach, the state space is partitioned into safe, warning, and critical regions. The safety monitor triggers interventions upon the system entering the warning regions to insure that transitions into critical regions are prevented. The authors also present an automated tool for the identification of warning states, and the synthesis of safety strategies given the available interventions. The main promise in the SMOF tool is the capability to produce a safety monitor given a system and a set of available interventions.\n</p><p>2.3.1 Application to Collision Avoidance\n</p><p>Collision avoidance (CA) requires not only the abstract safety rules that can be obtained with SMOF, but also the implementation of these rules. This includes detection and tracking of obstacles, and the needed planning and action steps for avoiding a collision. An overview of collision avoidance systems is found in [22]. It is noted that collision avoidance per se is not always attainable in automotive applications, and collision mitigation is a more realistic focus, i.e. reducing the severity of accidents. One main challenge, is defining the conditions in which the CA system should intervene. The author suggests examples where vehicles meet in a narrow road allowing little separation, and overtaking maneuvers that can be confused with imminent dangers. These challenges present a trade-off between effectiveness and unneeded interventions. Also, the work compares steering and braking maneuvers in terms of efficiency. For avoiding a head-on collision, with constant acceleration models the author shows that the needed separation distance is much higher with braking than steering as the initial speed increases. In fact, it was shown that with constant acceleration models, the separation distance is proportional to the square of velocity for braking, but linearly proportional to velocity for steering. The concept of \"decision functions\" is also presented in [22], in which dynamic models of the ego and other vehicles, as well as assumptions of future actions are basis for CA intervention decisions. Constant velocity and constant acceleration dynamic models are presented for estimating future trajectories. Several measures have been discussed for assessing the corresponding collision threat, including: distance, time to collision, closest point of approach, required acceleration, and others.\n</p><p>This thesis will present a different approach for integrating the two components, which is in alignment with the SMOF approach. Rather than using constant acceleration models, an approach will be shown involving time varying acceleration models for calculating the needed safety distance dynamically at run time, rather than only indicating a threat level or warning. This framework also allows for flexibility in defining the expectation of future actions of obstacles, which can be of help with the previously mentioned confusing scenarios (meeting at narrow roads and overtaking). However, this is not within the scope of this thesis and is not presented. In the following section, the main methodology is presented along with an example.\n</p><h3><p>3 Safety Monitoring for Collision Avoidance\n</p></h3><p>This section applies the SMOF safety monitoring approach to the context collision avoidance, both for the longitudinal (front and back) and lateral (sideways) cases. Next, the problem is formulated and the SMOF rule synthesis tool is tested with models for the two cases. The latter case will involve a much larger state space. After obtaining safety rules, the technical implementation of these rules is addressed.\n</p><h4><p>3.1 SMOF for Collision Avoidance\n</p></h4><p>In the SMOF framework, the safety system is responsible for monitoring safety and triggering interventions when the system transitions into a warning state. A formal description of the problem is presented next, but the reader may skip to Section 3.1.1 for an implementation of this approach. In the SMOF framework, the tasks may be viewed as follows:\n</p><p>1. Let the vehicle's surrounding regions be represented by a set of nondeterministic finite state machines (FSMs) Ri, i = 1, 2, 3, ...n, each possessing its own set of states Si, generators Σi, and\n</p><p>transition relations −→i with which jointly the FSMs satisfy constraints related to interdependency of different regions. Let the joint system be denoted by T = {R1, R2, R3, ..., Rn} with the space of possible states S, transition relations −→, and generators Σ. Given a catastrophic combination of the sets Sc ∈ S, obtain the set of predecessor warning states Sw\n</p><p>Sw = Pre(Sc) := { sw ∈ S : ∃σ ∈ Σ,∃sc ∈ Sc, sw σ−→ sc\n</p><p>} .\n</p><p>2. Specify the available monitor interventions that if associated to warning states sw ∈ Sw transitions into catastrophic states can be possibly canceled. This can also be viewed as introducing an additional FSM (the monitor), so that the joint system can have no catastrophic states. Let the monitor be given by M(Sm,Σm,−→m), T′ = {M,T} denotes the joint system with the monitor. The monitor's states are derived from the states of Ri through a function F . In other words, Sm = F (S1, S2, S3, ..., Sn). To cancel catastrophic transitions some dependency has to exist also between the generators of Ri and the monitor's generators. The task at this step is to suggest the monitor's state derivations and generators, such that a cancellation of catastrophic transitions can be possible.\n</p><p>3. Find the possible mappings between the available monitor interventions and the warning states sw ∈ Sw such that the catastrophic states are no longer reachable. In the FSM view of the monitor, we need to now find the transition relation such that @σm ∈ Σm, sc ∈ Sc that satisfy F−1(sm) σm−−→m sc. In the Joint system, the critical states are unreachable.\n</p><p>Referring back to the collision avoidance problem, the vehicle's autonomous driving systems contribute an additional actor P to T′. Its states that are relevant to safety are contained in the space of possible states for the system with no monitor Sp ⊂ S, but the generators Σ and transition relations −→ of T are pessimistically unconstrained by those of P .\n</p><p>In a comprehensive collision avoidance scenario, the vehicle's surrounding regions need to be considered longitudinally to avoid collisions from the front and back, laterally to avoid collisions from the sides, as well as possibly under the vehicle to avoid tires running on hazardous objects below. The boundaries for the zones depend on the possibilities for hazards and monitor interventions, and\nmust be chosen such that intervention specifications are implementable. This thesis will next discuss a longitudinal collision avoidance model, and build up to a model for combined longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance.\n</p><p>3.1.1 Longitudinal Collision Avoidance\n</p><p>For the longitudinal case, an occupancy grid is considered in the form shown in Figure 4, consisting of safe, warning and critical regions. The boundaries of the regions, in terms of both shape and distance, are beyond the scope of SMOF, and are treated separately as technical specifications.\n</p><p>In the figure, the critical region isRc, and the two warning regions areRf andRb, which respectively represent the front and back of the vehicle. With this simple model, the possibilities for obstacles to emerge into the critical region from below, or descend from above are not supported.\n</p><p>Figure 4: Occupancy grid for longitudinal model\n</p><p>The occupancy state of each warning region is modeled using a finite state machine, shown in Figure 5. The state begins with the region empty, and can become occupied if an object approaches. After which, the object may either continue to approach, or become relatively stationary. At this point, the status cannot change to empty before the object departs first.\n</p><p>Figure 5: Finite state machine representation of region status\n</p><p>The SMOF tool uses a template NuSMV model that includes a model of the system, and a model of accident causality. The occupancy FSM was implemented as a NuSMV module and instantiated in two variables representing the Rf and Rb regions. The accident model used defines an accident as an approaching state for two consecutive time steps in any region.\n</p><p>The tool identified the seven expected warning states:\n</p><p>• an approach in Rf , with empty, stationary, or departing Rb\n</p><p>• an approach in Rb, with empty, stationary, or departing Rf\n</p><p>• an approach in both Rf and Rb\n</p><p>The next step is to suggest interventions that can be used to synthesize safety strategies. The two obvious interventions for longitudinal collision avoidance would be to brake and to accelerate. The technical specification of interventions, as for physical boundaries of regions and time step, are beyond the scope of the SMOF methodology, and are to be addressed separately. However, the interventions suggested must be implementable for any resulting safety strategies to be viable. Braking is defined, at this stage, as simply braking sufficiently such that if a frontal approach occurs it does not persist in the next time step. The accelerate intervention is defined also in a similar way, assuming suitable technical implementation.\n</p><p>The brake and accelerate interventions are not adequate in the case of approaching states simultaneously in the two regions. As would be expected, the SMOF tool fails to find a safety strategy. To demonstrate the tool's synthesis capability, a third intervention has been added to allow for the possibility of avoiding accidents by transferring control to other systems or the driver. This could be criticized due to the various implementation challenges with such an intervention. Notwithstand-\ning, the transfer control intervention is assumed to be viable, and used simply to demonstrate safety strategy synthesis with SMOF.\n</p><p>The tool identifies four strategies. The expected strategy has been found, as shown below, while the other three strategies involve transferring control also when not approached simultaneously from the front and back.\n</p><p>• brake following a frontal approach\n</p><p>• accelerate following a backward approach\n</p><p>• transfer control following simultaneously both a forward and backward approach\n</p><p>This example demonstrates the SMOF approach and tool, where the safety monitoring rules are produced automatically according to user supplied models. The next section develops a model for combined longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance.\n</p><p>3.1.2 Longitudinal and Lateral Collision Avoidance\n</p><p>In this combined scenario, the lateral motion is accounted for in addition to the longitudinal motion modeled in the previous section, as well as the interaction between the two. This allows the following possibilities not available in the previous case:\n</p><p>• With awareness of the lateral dimension, collisions from the sides may also be avoided, rather than only the front and back.\n</p><p>• The safety distance needed can be lower if collisions can be avoided with steering, or both steering and longitudinal control.\n</p><p>As was previously noted, specification of region boundaries, the time step, as well as the technical implementation of interventions is beyond the scope of the SMOF approach. The occupancy grid considered is shown in Figure 6, with in addition to the Rf and Rb regions, the left and right regions Rl and Rr are included. The possibility for lower safety distance due to steering is not aimed at in this model, as it would require being able to differentiate between the left and right regions within both Rf and Rb (for example, steering left does not avoid obstacles at the front-left direction). This would require additional variables, and result in a larger state space. As was noted previously, state space explosion is a major concern with model checking.\n</p><p>Figure 6: Occupancy grid for combined longitudinal and lateral model\n</p><p>Using the same set of states as before, one way to model the combined longitudinal and lateral motion is to simply enumerate all possible combinations. For the longitudinal model, one region was described using four states. Lateral motion can be described similarly using the same four states. The number of combinations is 16. The number of transitions to set would then be 16 × 16 = 256. This approach was not pursued, although it is the obvious way. Instead, the previous model in Figure 5 was adapted with one instance used for each of the longitudinal and lateral motions within a region. Then, a few constraints were imposed to model the dependencies between lateral and longitudinal states within a region.\n</p><p>Each warning region is described by two FSMs of the form shown in Figure 7, one for the longitudinal and another for the lateral states.\n</p><p>Figure 7: Finite state machine representation of longitudinal/lateral components\n</p><p>Compared to the previous FSM, now all transitions are possible, due to motion from the other direction. To account for the interdependencies between the two FSMs, the following constraints are added (⇐⇒ and =⇒ denote logical equivalence and implication, respectively)\n</p><p>• empty laterally ⇐⇒ empty longitudinally\n</p><p>• longitudinally stationary or departing without previous approach =⇒ lateral approach\n</p><p>• longitudinally approaching and previously departing =⇒ lateral approach (previous object exited and new one entered)\n</p><p>• longitudinally empty and previously stationary or approaching =⇒ previous lateral depart\n</p><p>• laterally stationary or departing without previous approach =⇒ longitudinal approach\n</p><p>• laterally approaching and previously departing =⇒ longitudinal approach\n</p><p>• laterally empty and previously stationary or approaching =⇒ previous longitudinal depart\n</p><p>First the SMOF approach was attempted only with two regions, Rf and Rr. Accidents can be caused either by continuous longitudinal approach from the front, or continuous lateral approach from the right. The tool identified 51 warning states, which comprise of cases with either a frontal longitudinal approach, or a right lateral approach.\n</p><p>Two interventions were then used: braking and left steering. As explained in the previous section, the technical implementation of the interventions is not covered in the SMOF approach. Braking is defined as previously: decelerating sufficiently such that if a frontal approach occurs it does not persist in the next time step. Left steering is defined in a similar way with no reference to implementation. The tool finds the expected strategy:\n</p><p>• brake following a frontal longitudinal approach\n</p><p>• steer left following a right lateral approach\n</p><p>• brake and steer left following a simultaneous frontal longitudinal approach and right lateral approach\n</p><p>This successfully demonstrates the SMOF tool for a more complex application than previously seen in Section 3.1.1. Next, the two missing regions were added, namely the back and left regions, and the accident model was correspondingly extended. The SMOF tool was found unfortunately not feasible even in computing the warning states for the full model.\n</p><p>Although the tool has not been of assistance, this does not preclude using the SMOF architecture. Two additional interventions were added for acceleration and right steering, and a further transfer control intervention was added, following Section 3.1.1. A strategy was proposed manually and checked with NuSMV:\n</p><p>• brake if not longitudinally approached from the back and either approached longitudinally from the front or trapped laterally\n</p><p>• accelerate if not braking, and not longitudinally approached from the front and either approached longitudinally from the back or trapped laterally\n</p><p>• steer left if not laterally approached from the left and either approached laterally from the right or trapped longitudinally\n</p><p>• steer right if not steering left, and not laterally approached from the right and either approached laterally from the left or trapped longitudinally\n</p><p>• transfer control if trapped longitudinally, and trapped laterally\n</p><p>where \"trapped\" refers to when having obstacles in two opposite regions, i.e. front and back for longitudinal, while left and right for lateral trapping. In order to avoid conflicts when two opposing interventions are possible, preference is given to braking and left steering.\n</p><p>In the preceding sections, the SMOF tool has been demonstrated for the simple scenario of longitudinal collision avoidance, and for a more complex scenario with frontal and rightwards collision avoidance incorporating two dimensional motion. Although the tool suffered from the state space problem when applied to an even more complex model, a solution could be model checked successfully, allowing for the use of SMOF safety strategies. The main components in the SMOF approach\nis the partitioning of the state space to identify warning states, and the use of safety strategies, that when needed enact interventions to prevent transitions to critical states. These were achieved in all the cases considered in the previous sections. The following section examines the technical implementation aspects that need to be addressed.\n</p><h4><p>3.2 Safety Distance Using Time-Varying Acceleration Models\n</p></h4><p>Given predicted relative acceleration â(t) between the ego vehicle and the object (e.g. a leading/trailing vehicle), and initial relative speed v0, the task is to obtain the initial separation x0 that avoids a trajectory reaching 0 distance, if this is possible for â(t) and v0. The main result is derived in Appendix A, and stated as: ∫ 0\n</p><p>x0\n</p><p>â(t)dx = −1 2 v20 (1)\n</p><p>Equation 1 gives a relation between initial velocity and required separation for time-varying acceleration. An analytic solution requires an expression for the relative acceleration a(t) in terms of x, which is not available. Alternatively, a solution can be found numerically as will be shown in the next section. For the constant acceleration case the equation reduces to x0 =\n</p><p>v20\n</p><p>2ac\n</p><p>(2)\n</p><p>where ac is the constant acceleration.\n</p><p>To demonstrate a numerical approach to finding the needed separation distance in terms of initial relative speed, consider that the object moves towards the ego vehicle according to predicted acceleration curve ai(t), which is initially positive but decreases as the other object reacts to the situation, and consider that the ego vehicle is capable of acceleration profile as(t) in collision avoidance. For this example, assume that the two functions are of the form\n</p><p>ai(t) = R\n</p><p>(\n</p><p>2\n</p><p>1 − tanh(t)\n</p><p>)\n</p><p>as(t) = −ksR tanh(αs t).\n</p><p>R is the expected possible acceleration range in m/s2. The hyperbolic tangent has been used simply due to its shape containing transient and steady-state regions. A value of 4.3403 corresponds to 0-100km/hour in 6.4 seconds. ks is a scale factor representing the amount by which the magnitude of the ego vehicle's reaction is larger than the object's reaction, and αs represents the relative quickness in responding to the situation.\n</p><p>Let us use: R = 0.5, ks = 1.5, αs = 0.5 as example. The resulting functions are shown in Figure 8, with also the relative acceleration â(t) = ai(t) + as(t) plotted.\n</p><p>Figure 8: Time varying accelerations of the two objects\n</p><p>These simple models contain two phases: a transient response and a steady-state response. This assumes that the steady-state (of acceleration) continues indefinitely, implying that no reduction in deceleration occurs, and that collision avoidance efforts can persist as long as needed. However, in practice the relative acceleration may eventually go to zero, as would be the case with braking leading to a stopped vehicle.\n</p><p>The relative distance trajectory x(t) is found by integrating the acceleration twice:\n</p><p>d2x(t) dt2 = dv(t) dt\n</p><p>= â(t)\n</p><p>v(t) =\n</p><p>∫ t â(τ)dτ + v0\n</p><p>x(t) =\n</p><p>∫ t\n</p><p>0 ∫ γ\n</p><p>0 0\n</p><p>â(τ)dτdγ + v0t+ x0.\n</p><p>where v0 is the initial approach (relative) speed. For any v0, we can find the least separation (least negative x0) that ensures x(t) > 0, ∀t > 0. By iterating over different approach speeds we can obtain a relation between v0 and x0.\n</p><p>A speed of 40km/hour corresponds to 11.12m/s. Let us consider approach speeds in the range [0.1,11.12]. Figure 9 shows the least separation solutions for the different initial speeds v0. Notice that trajectories are always non positive for all the curves. Arriving at zero separation indicates that the initial separation is minimal. Due to the prolonged steady-state acceleration seen in Figure 8, the trajectory reverses after reaching zero separation (objects just touch then separate). The trajectory after zero separation is not of relevance for collision avoidance, and can be ignored.\n</p><p>Figure 9: Solution trajectories for different initial speeds v0\n</p><p>Finally a relation between v0 and x0 can be obtained, as shown in Figure 10.\n</p><p>Figure 10: v0 to x0 relation\n</p><p>Let us now consider the constant acceleration case to find how the required initial separation distance compares to the result in Figure 10. It is not apparent how one should select a value of ac in Equation 2. As example, consider the steady-state, average, median, and 25th percentile accelerations during the initial 10 seconds. Figure 11 shows the results for these constant estimates obtained by invoking Equation 2, together with the time-varying acceleration result.\n</p><p>Figure 11: v0 to x0 relation for constant acceleration\n</p><p>Optimistic separation distances were found for all the constant acceleration cases. The steady-state (minimum) acceleration yielded the most optimistic separation, as would be expected. The median is the acceleration at 5s in Figure 8, which is very close to the steady state. The 25th percentile is 2.5s in the figure. The average is the most conservative but still gives optimistic separation distance. These results indicate the significance of the initial period where the approach speed is high but little deceleration is taking place.\n</p><p>In the approach presented in this section, collisions can be avoided if the separation is greater than the obtained safety distance value. This gives the distance boundary needed in the SMOF approach, for interventions to be viable. The calculation uses relative motion in one direction. The boundary can be constructed along any direction of interest provided the following are available along that direction:\n</p><p>• Current speed of approach between ego vehicle and object\n</p><p>• Knowledge of ego vehicle's acceleration capability\n</p><p>• Expectation for future acceleration of the object\n</p><p>Once the object is within this physical boundary, interventions can be triggered according to the safety strategies used.\n</p><p>Next in this thesis, a case study is presented which employs simulation to test and demonstrate SMOF safety monitoring for collision avoidance. The main motivation in this work is safety assurance for learning systems. The study will deploy a vision-based autonomous driving function, along with safety monitoring using the approach discussed thus far.\n</p><h3><p>4 Case Study: Safety Monitoring for Vision-Based Vehicle Control\n</p></h3><p>This section presents an implementation of safety monitoring and vehicle control toolchains within a simulation environment. A deep learning system will be used to drive a simulated vehicle, and experiments will be performed to investigate safety with malfunctioning vehicle control.\n</p><p>Previous sections have discussed the safety concerns with learning systems in autonomous driving, and the difficulty of verifying their safety properties. Instead, an architectural safety monitoring approach is pursued in this thesis. Section 3.1 applied the SMOF safety monitoring approach to collision avoidance, and Section 3.2 discussed an approach for obtaining the distance boundary needed for interventions to be viable. This section studies a case where a learning system controls the vehicle, and develops a framework for supporting safety investigations. The scenario consists of a vision-based speed control system for longitudinal motion, along with a collision avoidance safety system to mitigate risks due to faults in the learning system.\n</p><p>Driving simulators are of help in this study, both for generating synthetic data, and for testing the effectiveness of safety systems. The experimental approach depends greatly on the capabilities offered by the driving simulator, and computational resources available. This topic is addressed next, after which the control toolchain and the experiments are presented.\n</p><h4><p>4.1 Driving Simulation\n</p></h4><p>The motivation for using driving simulators in this study is that they can offer the possibility to experiment with driving scenarios that are difficult, and costly, to create in a real environment. For example, factors that make real-world experiments prohibitive are: access to vehicles and needed hardware, ensuring tests are safe, needing to perform system identification or measure relevant parameters, setting up prototype autonomous driving systems, the time to set up and conduct experiments, and also the difficulty of setting up controlled experiments when relevant variables cannot be controlled. With driving simulators, it is possible to work at a higher level of abstraction focusing more closely on the learning and safety systems at the functional level. The driving environment can be interfaced with system models as part of a software-in-the-loop or model-in-the-loop setup, which helps in evaluating functional safety.\n</p><p>Specifically for this vision-based speed control study, the elements needed in a driving simulator are the following.\n</p><p>• off-line data export The quantities that are relevant to training need to be available for off-line use. These include: image frames, distance traveled by ego vehicle, distances to other vehicles of interest, acceleration and brake pedal positions, simulation time, as well as any other interesting information for training.\n</p><p>• closed loop control To pursue control in a dynamic virtual world environment, there needs to be a possibility for using the above quantities in a closed loop setup where data is processed and control is sent to the vehicle during simulation. This can require synchronization between several simulation software components and user models.\n</p><p>• adequate virtual world A basic level of scientific accuracy is needed in the simulation environment. This includes the physics of the vehicles within the environment, and also the visual appearance of virtual world.\n</p><p>Three virtual driving simulators have been tried to assess their potential to support vision-based control studies: IPG CarMaker, TESIS DYNA4, and TASS PreScan. These simulators are discussed in the following subsections.\n</p><p>4.1.1 IPG CarMaker\n</p><p>CarMaker is a virtual testing platform for passenger cars and light-duty vehicles. The simulator can be interfaced with the MATLAB/Simulink environment using CarMaker's provided templates that include S-function blocks. The user's control strategies can be implemented either by manipulating Simulink signals or by creating custom modules. CarMaker can be run either stand-alone, or in cosimulation with Simulink.\n</p><p>CarMaker offers possibilities for offline data export. After simulations, image frames can be obtained from the animation tool either by exporting video frames, or by exporting a video. However, timestamps are not available if the image frames are exported directly. The data plotting tool, IPG-Control, can be used for exporting simulation variables into a csv file. To capture data, IPGControl needs to be configured before simulations.\n</p><p>Except for a camera feed, all our needed quantities can be used directly in a closed loop setup within Simulink. IPG offers the Video Data Stream (VDS) extension package which allows sending video out of the animation tool via TCP, and includes some additional features for adding camera noise, motion blur, etc. This feature was not included in my initial trail, and had to be requested specifically. Using the additional visual features greatly reduces simulation and movie export speeds. Once a camera is configured within CarMaker, the animation tool, which is a separate program, sends out the video stream via TCP. After making several attempts to receive the video in Simulink using different approaches, at best the received images contained some distortions/artifacts, and the animation tool did not synchronize successfully with Simulink.\n</p><p>As for other factors, CarMaker meets the needs adequately with regards to scientific accuracy of the simulations and visual appearance of the virtual world.\n</p><p>4.1.2 TESIS DYNAware DYNA4\n</p><p>DYNA4 is simulation framework aimed at supporting vehicle development processes, and runs within Simulink, allowing for signals to be accessed and manipulated. Users can also configure and add new Simulink modules from within DYNA4.\n</p><p>To export data for offline use, one can select the needed quantities before the simulation, and then a mat file with needed variables is produced after its completion. DYNA4 stores the data needed to recreate the animation after simulations. Video can then be played back or exported, for any completed simulation.\n</p><p>Data signals are available for closed loop control, however, in the commercially available DYNA4 product camera pixels are not accessible in Simulink. TESIS kindly allowed me the opportunity to test a development version which includes this functionality. To obtain the camera feed for closed loop control, the camera is configured within DYNA4, and a receiver block is added to the corresponding Simulink model of the simulation project. A blocking communication is setup between the animation tool and Simulink, allowing for pixel data be accessed simply.\n</p><p>DYNA4 offers a visually appealing animation which can support our vision-based control investigation, as well as an adequately accurate virtual world.\n</p><p>4.1.3 TASS PreScan\n</p><p>Prescan offers a simulation framework for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Intelligent Vehicle (IV) systems, targeted more for the simulation of sensors and the virtual environment, rather that vehicle dynamics. Simulink is also used as a simulation engine. After the scenario is configured in a GUI tool, a Simulink model is generated. ADAS functions can be implemented simply by modifying the generated models. Also, a wide variety of demos are provided featuring different ADAS functions, allowing for users to substitute their own algorithms. Sensor technologies such as radar, laser, camera, ultrasonic, GPS and C2C/C2I communications, are supported. A physics-based camera model is also available, which accounts for a complete pipeline from light sources to optics and final image.\n</p><p>One notable aspect with PreScan is its strong integration with MATLAB and Simulink, allowing for a lot of possibilities for accessing signals and controlling various elements of the virtual world, e.g. all simulation vehicles, pedestrians, sensors, and even lightposts. RGB pixels are also available conveniently in Simulink, facilitating camera-based ADAS function development. Furthermore, simulation runs can be automated with MATLAB scripts, which allows for performing tests with changed parameters and collecting results for processing, or exporting the data. Video can also be exported in different formates using a GUI visualization tool.\n</p><p>Simple vehicle dynamics models are available in PreScan, which can be freely modified in Simulink. For more complex dynamics, PreScan allows for integration with other tools, such as CarSim and veDYNA.\n</p><h4><p>4.2 Vision to Speed Control\n</p></h4><p>Since the focus of this work is on learning systems in safety critical automotive applications, an example system is considered that controls the speed of the ego vehicle using camera images of the road. This study is delimited to longitudinal speed control, although a more comprehensive model was developed in Section 3.1.2.\n</p><p>The scenario consists of one leading vehicle fixed at some distance ahead of the ego vehicle. The task of the learning system is to detect the leading vehicle, and feed this information to a controller which then controls the gas and brake pedal positions. In such a setup, the output of the learning system can be readily compared to ground-truth for analysis.\n</p><p>A deep neural network is used to detect the leading vehicle and provide bounding box information to be used for speed control. Since the distance to the leading vehicle is directly related to the bounding box size, a simple power-law function can be used to obtain a control signal, which then determines the gas and brake pedal positions.\n</p><p>Using such a setup where the learning system outputs intermediate bounding box information has some benefits:\n</p><p>• This corresponds to a logical subproblem to the main speed control problem. If an end-to-end approach were used, the learning system would instead map pixel data to gas/brake pedal control. As discussed in Section 2.1, logical subsystems of end-to-end systems cannot be inspected, which allows a possibility for faults to be masked.\n</p><p>• The ground truth is simple to determine, and depends only on images. In fact, the detector's performance can be assessed intuitively by viewing the resulting image sequence. For an end-to-end system, in contrast, the ground truth may depend on other factors such as the current speed and acceleration.\n</p><p>• Since the scenario involves only one leading vehicle, the bounding box is sufficient information for a control strategy.\n</p><p>• Many pretrained object detectors are available, allowing for the possibility of experimenting with existing state of the art networks.\n</p><p>The function of the learning system in this study is to identify the leading vehicle in camera images containing the road, environment, scenery and other traffic objects. For such a problem, object localization as well as classification are needed. One interesting approach is to use a region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN), which includes a region proposal network and an object classification network. A recent advancement in using this architecture is the Faster R-CNN [23, 24], where the classification network shares full-image convolutional features with the region proposal network, which enables nearly cost-free region proposals. The experiments presented in the following section employ a Faster R-CNN trained for localizing and classifying the leading vehicle.\n</p><h4><p>4.3 Experiments\n</p></h4><p>The experimental setup considered consists of an empty stretch of road with one fixed vehicle located some distance ahead of the ego vehicle. A camera is placed behind the front windshield of the ego vehicle, and a Faster R-CNN system processes the images in order to control the speed. This simple experimental setup allows for testing only frontal collision avoidance. Extensions could be made in order to study more comprehensive scenarios, especially where the safety strategies are complex. However, this was not attempted in this experiment. More complex monitoring scenarios would help to test safety monitors, but contribute little to a safety investigation of the fundamental concerns with learning systems.\n</p><p>The strategy computed for the SMOF safety monitor in the longitudinal case (see Section 3.1.1) was to trigger a braking intervention when the warning region is in an approach state. This occurs as soon as when the distance to the leading vehicle becomes less than the safe distance. A key point is that the safety monitor can trigger interventions, rather than passively monitor, or only block actions, and technical specifications of interventions and region boundaries allow for guaranteeing collision avoidance if the specifications hold. The monitor calculates the safe distance dynamically based on the ego vehicle's current speed and the relative acceleration, using the approach presented in Section 3.2. Since in this simplified setup the leading vehicle is stationary, only the ego vehicle's deceleration curve is needed in the calculation.\n</p><p>Figure 12 shows a block diagram of the control setup used for experiments. Camera images are used to control the speed of the ego vehicle, with a safety monitor installed to intervene when a warning state is reached. Ground truth information is used for safety monitoring, as this avoids introducing additional points of failure extraneous to the learning system under study.\n</p><p>Figure 12: Control loop with safety monitoring\n</p><p>The goals for experiments are twofold: firstly to simulate the safety monitoring and vision-based control toolchains and demonstrate collision avoidance in cases of hazardous speed control; and secondly to discuss an example trustworthiness indicator for the learning system, which can help warn in advance before severe safety interventions are needed. This is related to the Safe Fail strategy mentioned in Section 2, in which the system does not attempt to offer an output in case of low confidence, or closeness to the decision boundary, and the operator makes the decision instead. However, in the speed control context, it is not possible to expect for the driver to immediately take over. The trustworthiness indication approach in this thesis allows for the driver to be warned regarding the learning system in a low confidence scenario.\n</p><p>4.3.1 Design of Experiments\n</p><p>The Neural Network Toolbox in MATLAB 2017a offers an implementation of the Faster R-CNN deep learning system, including a class object and a function to train the detector. Although code from the Faster R-CNN authors is publicly available [23, 24], The implementation in the toolbox was opted for, due to ease of use and possibly quicker development time. Flexibility in regard to tweaking and tailoring algorithms for better performance is not a primary goal for this project.\n</p><p>The virtual world contains a straight stretch of road with some trees along the sides, and one\nvehicle fixed 300m ahead of the ego vehicle. The only variable that affects the camera images is the ego vehicle's position along the road. Therefore, by simply passing the camera along the road it is possible to capture images at any needed distance resolution.\n</p><p>This scenario avoids needing to perform image processing online. Image processing and driving simulation are computationally expensive tasks. At the time of conducting the work for this thesis, an adequate computational setup was not yet available, and the available GPU was not supported by MATLAB. This greatly limits the achievable frame rate as the detector is run on CPU instead. For 500x375 images, the detector computes at around 0.15 fps on the available machine, rather than 5 fps in the Faster R-CNN author's papers. For a closed loop setup, the detector would need to run in Simulink as an extrinsic function, since code generation for the Faster R-CNN object detector class is not supported in Simulink. The 0.15 fps would therefore not be improved. In addition, driving simulators are also computational expensive which further limits the speed. A closed-loop setup with such computational limitations would hinder the prototyping and evaluation of systems.\n</p><p>On the other hand, if a more complex scenario with moving objects were used, the camera images would depend on several variables that would be difficult to control, necessitating a closed-loop setup. As online image processing is not pursued, any of the previously mentioned virtual vehicle simulators could be used: IPG CarMaker, TESIS DYNA4, and TASS PreScan. CarMaker was selected primarily because it was made available before the other two. PreScan, along with a suitable computer setup for simulation was available only after completing the work for this thesis. The test vehicle chosen is the demo Tesla S model example provided in CarMaker, which uses an electrical powertrain, and a camera was added behind the front windshield.\n</p><p>The ego vehicle was passed along the road at low speed and the frontal camera's video stream was exported, and then processed to produce images at 0.1m resolution. These images are used for training and testing, as well as to precompute detections at 0.1m intervals along the road for access during simulations. The labeling process requires manually drawing the bounding box of the leading vehicle in each image. This process was automated with the help of the MATLAB Ground Truth Labeler app, which can interpolate between manually made labels at key frames.\n</p><p>Due to computational limitations, small 128x228 images were used. Training of a Faster R-CNN is a four step process. In the first step, the region proposal network (RPN) is trained. In the second, a separate detection network is trained using the proposals from step 1 RPN. In the third step, the detector is used to initialize the RPN, but only the layers unique to the RPN are trained. Finally in the fourth step, the layers unique to the detector are trained. One problem that occurred frequently in my training attempts is that no positive or negative samples may be found in the fourth step, when the proposals from the third step are used. At far distances from the leading vehicle, less pixels are used to represent the vehicle, which presents a challenge in training. The training process could complete only if far distances are excluded.\n</p><p>The leading vehicle is 300m ahead along the road. Detectors for two different distance ranges were investigated:\n</p><p>1. A detector was trained for the distance ranges 250-270m and 280-295m, using 351 training images.\n</p><p>2. A detector was trained for the distance range 270-295m, using 251 training images.\n</p><p>4.3.2 Safety Monitoring\n</p><p>For calculating the safety distance dynamically at run time, the deceleration curve of the ego vehicle, and the expected acceleration curve of the leading vehicle are needed. Modeling the behavior of\nthe leading vehicle for collision avoidance scenarios is an interesting topic for dedicated research. Discussed in [22] is the concept of decision functions, in which dynamic models of the two vehicles and the expectation of their future actions are used as the basis for decisions. The scenario in this simple study uses a stationary leading vehicle, and the safety monitor is designed based on this operating condition. Also, the braking curve can vary with different road conditions. In this study, the effect of different road conditions is not investigated, and could be also a topic for further work.\n</p><p>To determine the braking curve of the Tesla demo vehicle model, braking tests were performed on the same road to be used in the experiments. Figure 13 shows the braking behavior for different starting speeds until the vehicle is stopped. It takes approximately 1.5 seconds to reach maximum deceleration, which continues until the vehicle is almost stopped. As shown in the figure, this initial phase is the same regardless of the starting speed. Inspecting the distance traveled in the final phase when going back to zero acceleration shows that it is only a few centimeters (2-4 cm). For safety monitoring, only the initial phase and the maximum deceleration phase will be used in safety distance calculation.\n</p><p>Figure 13: Braking deceleration for CarMaker test vehicle\n</p><p>4.3.3 Control System\n</p><p>The speed of the ego vehicle is controlled via the gas and brake pedal position signals in the CarMaker Simulink model. The Faster R-CNN system outputs bounding boxes (this locates the object within the image) and corresponding scores of detected objects classified as the leading vehicle. The area of the highest scoring bounding box is used as an indirect indicator of the leading vehicle's distance. This applies since the vehicles are configured to be in the same lane. The control law then used to obtain an intermediate signal is in the following form\n</p><p>u = Aα\n</p><p>where A is the bounding box area (width × height pixels) divided by the image area, and α is a tunable parameter that affect the cautiousness of the resulting control. The resulting signal u takes values from the 0-1 range. The gas and brake pedal positions can be derived from u according to:\n</p><p>brake =\n</p><p>{\n</p><p>2 (u− 0.5) u > 0.5\n</p><p>0 u ≤ 0.5\n</p><p>gas =\n</p><p>{\n</p><p>−2 (u− 0.5) u &lt; 0.5\n</p><p>0 u ≥ 0.5\n</p><p>which results in braking with no gas when u is larger than 0.5, and gas with no brakes otherwise. Both gas and brake pedals are not engaged when u = 0.5.\n</p><p>This control strategy is implemented in Simulink as shown in Figure 14, with also a moving average included to smooth out u. This is helpful especially for malfunctioning detector behavior with momentary object appearance or disappearance. The window size used is 200 samples. The simulation is configured for variable step size in the CarMaker Simulink interface, but inspection shows that 200 samples correspond to about 0.2 seconds of simulation time.\n</p><p>Figure 14: Simulink control system for brake and gas pedal\n</p><p>Simulations were performed using ground truth bounding box information in order to calibrate the α parameter, and a suitable value found was 0.1. Figure 15 shows the resulting vehicle speed and the corresponding control signals. The vehicle was initialized at 100km/hour (ca. 27.8m/s). Figure 16 shows the distance trajectory, with the accident distance marked.\n</p><p>Figure 15: Speed control for α = 0.1, and ground truth detections.\n</p><p>Figure 16: Distance curve for α = 0.1, and ground truth detections.\n</p><p>4.3.4 Evaluation Metrics\n</p><p>Two detectors for different distance ranges will be tested. The training difficulties were previously noted with regard to far distances, and training had to be restricted to closer distances for it to succeed. The first detector was trained for 250-270 and 280-295m, using 351 training images. Training did not yield good performance even within this training set, but this presents an interesting case for safety studies, as will be discussed. The second detector was trained for the easier 270-295m, using 251 training images. Much better performance could be achieved for this case within the training range, but this limited range helps to illustrate how a learning system can perform well for some data that was represented in the training, but cause hazardous behavior with unseen data.\n</p><p>The metric we will use for evaluating the performance of the learning system is the Intersection over Union (IoU) which is defined as IoU(A,B) =\n</p><p>area(A ∩B) area(A ∪B)\n</p><p>where A and B are the ground truth and detector bounding boxes. When multiple detections are produced by the detector, the highest scoring detection is used. The IoU does not distinguish between\nfalse positives and false negatives, but is a common metric for evaluating detectors and is sufficient given that false positives would trigger unwarranted braking.\n</p><p>Another measure that is of interest in this research is related to the similarity/dissimilarity of incoming camera images with the training images. Since the network is trained entirely using synthetic data from CarMaker, the influence of the training data can be controlled and accounted for. In addition, the random seed for the training process was fixed to insure reproducibility of the training results.\n</p><p>An example measure which utilizes SURF [25] features is used in these experiments. The SURF features of the highest scoring interest point in images are computed and used as descriptors. The disparity measure used in the experiments computes the Euclidean distance between the computed features of the runtime images to the nearest neighbor in the training set. SURF was chosen due to its speed advantages and scale invariance property. Other methods are not investigated in this study, but could be a topic for further research.\n</p><p>4.3.5 First Detector\n</p><p>This detector was trained with 351 128x228 images for 250-270, and 280-295m distances. As previously mentioned, the less pixels used to represent the vehicle, the more difficult is the learning task. Attempts at training with the full 0-300m distance range have failed, and hence training was focused on closer distances where the leading vehicle is larger in the image. This detector was trained for 25 epochs.\n</p><p>Figure 17 shows the IoU and disparity for the first detector, with the two distance ranges shaded. The measurements were filtered using a moving average of the same length as the moving average used for u, and 1 standard deviation curves are also plotted. The disparity is zero within the training intervals, as the incoming data was represented in the training set. On the other hand, distances away from the training intervals yielded high disparity, which decreases closer to the intervals. Ideally, the disparity measure should vary smoothly with distance, but this was seen not to be the case with using SURF features of a single interest point. Nonetheless, the metric helps to demonstrate that a disparity measure can be used to judge how well new data was represented in training. The detections were completely erroneous in the first trained interval, 250-270, as indicated by the IoU, while some detection capability is seen in the second trained interval 280-295.\n</p><p>Figure 17: IoU and disparity mean and ± 1 standard deviation curves for the poor performing first detector. Notice low disparity close to and between training ranges.\n</p><p>Figure 18 shows the trajectory of the ego vehicle along the road. An intervention was triggered, which successfully brought the vehicle to a halt before colliding with the leading vehicle.\n</p><p>Figure 18: Distance trajectory along the road for the first detector, with braking intervention triggered\n</p><p>The speed control is shown in Figure 19, with the vehicle initialized at the start of the road with 0km/hour. A false positives period (vehicle detected as at close distance when it is actually farther away) caused braking starting at around 4 seconds. This is followed by a period where the detector is making some detections which are not accurate, as indicated by IoU in Figure 17. Afterwards, false negatives (vehicle detected as far away when it is actually near) caused an approach with high speed, which necessitates an intervention well before the trained intervals are encountered. In fact, the controller requested braking only towards the end of simulation when a good IoU is obtained.\n</p><p>Figure 19: Speed control for the first detector. Dashed lines indicate overridden signal. False +ives indicate detecting a very near vehicle when it is in fact farther away, while false -ives indicate that the vehicle is detected as far away when it is in fact near.\n</p><p>4.3.6 Second Detector\n</p><p>In light of the poor performance of the first detector, especially in its first trained distance range, a second attempt was made to train another detector with closer distances, making the learning task less difficult. The distance range was limited to 270-295m, and a detector was trained for 25 epochs with 251 training images.\n</p><p>Training indicated some success in learning within the trained distances. Two experiments are performed to illustrate both non-malfunctioning behavior where safety interventions are not required, and malfunctioning behavior that triggers the monitor interventions. In a low speed experiment, the needed safety distance does not exceed the trained range, which allows the controller an opportunity to operate within the learning system's trained distance range. Another experiment with higher approach speed was then performed, and a monitor intervention was necessary, since the learning system malfunctioned outside its trained distance range.\n</p><p>Low speed experiment\n</p><p>For this experiment, the setup is initialized such that the learning system is allowed an opportunity\nto function within its trained distance range. Approaching at 70km/h would trigger an intervention at the start of the trained distance range, precluding the possibility of observing the controller's performance. The detector was seen to suffer from a false positives problem that brings the vehicle to a halt prematurely if initialized at the start of the road. To address these problems, the vehicle was initialized at 250m along the road with 35km/h.\n</p><p>Figure 20 shows the IoU and disparity for the second detector. The measurements were filtered as before with detector 1 with the same moving average, and ±1 standard deviation curves are plotted. As indicated by the IoU, much better performance is attained within the learned distance range. The disparity is zero within the training intervals, as before, and is higher away from the trained data. The trend in disparity tends to be inversely related to the IoU performance measure.\n</p><p>Figure 20: IoU and disparity mean and ± 1 standard deviation curves for the second detector low speed experiment.\n</p><p>Figure 21 shows the trajectory of the ego vehicle along the road. An intervention was not required, as the controller successfully brought the vehicle to a halt before colliding with the obstacle.\n</p><p>Figure 21: Distance trajectory along the road for the second detector low speed experiment, with braking intervention not triggered\n</p><p>Figure 22 shows the speed control of the vehicle, initialized at the start of the road with 35km/hour. Light braking was requested initially in an untrained distance before 1.5s. Notice that this coincides with the IoU peak in Figure 20. Afterwards, braking was revoked and the gas pedal was increased briefly. Breaking is triggered again after the trained distance range is reached, stopping the vehicle before a collision.\n</p><p>Figure 22: Speed control for the second detector low speed experiment.\n</p><p>High speed experiment\n</p><p>In the high speed experiment with the second detector, the vehicle is instead initialized at 150m along the road, with 120km/h. At this speed, the needed safety distance is beyond the learning system's trained range. If the control fails to adequately brake prior to reaching the trained range, then a safety intervention would be needed.\n</p><p>Figure 23 shows the filtered IoU and disparity curves in this experiment. The same trend is observed as previously in the other experiments, where the IoU performance tends to be inversely related to the run-time calculated disparity.\n</p><p>Figure 23: IoU and disparity mean and ±1 standard deviation curves for the second detector high speed experiment.\n</p><p>Figure 24 shows the trajectory of the ego vehicle along the road. As for the previous experiment with the first detector seen in Section 4.3.5, an intervention was triggered, which successfully stopped the vehicle and avoided the collision.\n</p><p>Figure 24: Distance trajectory along the road for the second detector high speed experiment, with braking intervention triggered\n</p><p>Figure 25 shows the speed control of the vehicle. Due to false positives (vehicle detected as at close distance when it is actually farther away), strong braking was activated before 1s. During this period zero IoU coupled with disparity peaks are observed in Figure 23. Shortly afterwards, false negatives (vehicle detected as far away when it is actually near) are obtained, which cause unsafe acceleration requiring an intervention. The controller continues to request acceleration until just before 4s where we have previously observed diminishing disparity. However, unlike for the low speed experiment, the controller requested braking too late and was already overridden by the safety monitor.\n</p><p>Figure 25: Speed control for the second detector high speed experiment.\n</p><h4><p>4.4 Findings\n</p></h4><p>In the experiments, the SMOF architecture has been used along with dynamic safety distances. The braking intervention was triggered at the right moments to prevent an accident, which resulted in the ego vehicle stopping only a few meters from collision. In addition, an example indicator for the learning system's trustworthiness has been demonstrated.\n</p><p>The disparity measure in the experiments tended to be inversely related to the learning system's performance, which is expected as performance should be better with data similar to the training set. This also suggests a potential for runtime trustworthiness indication using a disparity approach. Further research could investigate the development of better indicators and the desirable properties they should possess. For example, the disparity indicator used the features of only the highest scoring SURF interest point. In theory, SURF interest points are scale invariant and should not greatly fluctuate as the ego vehicle approaches the other vehicle. However, some fluctuations were observed in the experiments. Brief inspections showed that, for some distances, the highest scoring interest point can change abruptly for minor variation in scale. It could help to investigate combining several interest points, but this would increase the computational demand. Also, SURF operates on gray-scale images. This overlooks possibly essential color information that can affect the performance of the learning system. Other approaches can be tested that incorporate spatial as well as color features\nof images.\n</p><p>of images.\n</p><p>The motivation behind the disparity measure is to obtain a reliable trustworthiness metric that can be computed at run time for incoming data in order to indicate the performance of the learning system. The best ways to utilize this trustworthiness indication could also be a topic for further research. Using it within a safety monitor would yield a more complex monitor, and present challenges with verification or certification. However, such trustworthiness metric can be of help in alerting the driver before a safety monitor intervention is required. Safety interventions can be unpleasant for the driver, as is the case with the full force braking used in the experiments.\n</p><h3><p>5 Discussion\n</p></h3><p>This section discusses and summarizes the thesis, and points to possible directions for further work.\n</p><p>The safety concerns with learning systems were discussed in Section 2. Several concerns emerge from the loss functions and the training data used for developing learning systems. When using quantities such as average prediction error, loss functions may not account for the human cost that is relevant for safety. The training samples may not correctly reflect the scenario that was aimed for, and may inadequately represent rare cases that are highly relevant for safety. Learning systems were discussed for autonomous driving, with particular focus on end-to-end systems. The end-to-end paradigm, discussed in Section 2.1 is an extremely capable approach where complex learning problems are solved implicitly by the systems, without the need to identify and address the logical subproblems. From a safety viewpoint, this compounds the challenges associated with obtaining adequate training data, due to possible fault masking effects. Following a discussion of some relevant sections of the ISO 26262, a promising approach was indicated for meeting safety goals, which involve introducing separate architectural elements that are more amenable to meeting stringent safety requirements, while the learning systems themselves can be exempt from needing to comply with the standard. It was discussed also that verifying properties of learning systems at the technical/mathematical level may not be of help in autonomous driving applications, as that would involve specifying properties of input pixel values and output quantities. Instead, a safety monitoring approach was motivated.\n</p><p>Safety monitoring was discussed in Section 2.3. Formal methods and model checking are useful tools in the design of safety monitors. However, important to consider is the state space explosion problem that can limit the scalability of model checkers. The SMOF safety monitoring approach was found particularly interesting, due to the possibility for monitors that implement interventions, rather than only inhibitions, and the possibility of automatically generating safety strategies. This approach has been applied to a longitudinal collision avoidance scenario, and also a scenario targeting combined longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance. Technical implementation aspects of interventions were also discussed, and an approach was presented for calculating region boundaries using time-varying acceleration models.\n</p><p>A case study was presented in Section 4, involving the use of a learning system to control the vehicle's speed using camera pixel data. The use of simulations for supporting this study was discussed, with important considerations being functionalities for off-line data export, closed loop control, and an adequate virtual world accuracy. Three simulation tools were tried: IPG CarMaker, TESIS DY-NAware, and TASS PreScan. CarMaker was not found to support a vision-based closed loop control setup, but was nonetheless used due to its earlier availability, and challenges with computational resources and time that anyway preclude online closed loop control. A simple scenario was pursued, for which offline processing helps in avoiding the online processing needed in a closed loop setup. Experiments were built within a simulation environment for frontal collision avoidance, including safety monitoring and control toolchains. The SMOF architecture was used, and interventions were triggered following dangerous malfunctioning behavior in the learning system. Finally, also an indicator was presented for the trustworthiness of the learning system during operation.\n</p><p>Further work could investigate simulations with more complex safety monitoring scenarios, beyond the frontal collision avoidance tested in this thesis. In implementing safety interventions with the approach presented in this thesis, an essential information is the expected future trajectory of the object. This was not studied, and the object was simply assumed to be stationary in the experiments.\n</p><p>This topic can be investigated in a further work. If the solution is probabilistic, that would present an interesting concern with regard to determinism in safety monitoring. Finally, a simple example was offered in this thesis to illustrate trustworthiness indication, and little effort was aimed at developing a good performing metric. This topic could be further investigated, including the application of such indicator within safety systems. It is important in particular that computation is feasible online.\n</p><h3><p>References\n</p></h3><p>[1] \"Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems,\" Standard SAE J3016, Society of Automotive Engineers, 2016.\n</p><p>[2] P.

Applikationsområden inkluderar mönsterigenkänning, datorseende, tal‐ och språkförståelse. När utvecklingen inom bilindustrin går mot en ökad grad av automatisering, blir problemen som måste lösas alltmer komplexa, vilket har lett till ett ökat användande av metoder från maskininlärning och deep learning. Med detta tillvägagångssätt lär sig systemet lösningen till ett problem implicit från träningsdata och man kan inte direkt utvärdera lösningens korrekthet. Detta innebär problem när systemet i fråga är del av en säkerhetskritisk funktion, vilket är fallet för självkörande fordon. Detta examensarbete behandlar säkerhetsaspekter relaterade till maskininlärningssystem i autonoma fordon och applicerar en safety monitoring‐metodik på en kollisionsundvikningsfunktion. Simuleringar utförs, med ett deep learning‐system som del av systemet för perception, som ger underlag för styrningen av fordonet, samt en safety monitor för kollisionsundvikning. De relaterade operationella situationerna och säkerhetsvillkoren studeras för en autonom körnings‐funktion, där potentiella fel i det lärande systemet introduceras och utvärderas.

Application areas include pattern recognition, computer vision, speech and natural language processing. With the automotive industry aiming for increasing amount of automation in driving, the problems to solve become increasingly complex, which appeals to the use of supervised learning methods from Machine Learning and Deep Learning. With this approach, solutions to the problems are learned implicitly from training data, and inspecting their correctness is not possible directly. This presents concerns when the resulting systems are used to support safety-critical functions, as is the case with autonomous driving of automotive vehicles. This thesis studies the safety concerns related to learning systems within autonomous driving and applies a safety monitoring approach to a collision avoidance scenario. Experiments are performed using a simulated environment, with a deep learning system supporting perception for vehicle control, and a safety monitor for collision avoidance. The related operational situations and safety constraints are studied for an autonomous driving function, with potential faults in the learning system introduced and examined. Also, an example is considered for a measure that indicates trustworthiness of the learning system during operation.\n\niv\n\nv\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI would like to thank all the people who contributed in some way to this thesis project.

Automation systems are needed to deliver important functions that can be safety critical. Safety concerns become more difficult to tackle when the solutions to complex automation problems emerge from deep learning or machine learning, and involve elements that are non deterministic, and difficult to inspect for correctness. The research questions are formulated in this section, along with the corresponding delimitations. An outline of the thesis is then presented, followed by a list of contributions.\n\nAutomation is expected to continue to take on important functions in various products and services used by society. In safety-critical applications, faults in automation can have great consequences such as loss of life, damage to property, and financial losses. The safety of such systems needs to be assured with good confidence. The focus of this thesis is particularly on automation within autonomous driving. The SAE J3016 standard [1] describes five levels of driving automation, ranging from basic driver assistance in level 1, to full automation under all driving situations in level 5. The commercially available technology is currently at level 2, and higher levels are being developed. Audi has recently announced its A8 model for 2018 featuring level 3 automation [2]. With level 3, automated systems control the vehicle and monitor the environment under some driving modes, but a human driver is expected to intervene when requested as a fall-back measure.\n\nEmbedded systems are essential to many automation functionalities in autonomous vehicles. Several definitions exist for embedded systems, and more commonly relate to hardware and software aspects. For example, [3] offers a concise definition where \"Embedded systems are systems which include a computer but are not used for general purpose computing.\" From a systems engineering perspective, a definition that can be suitable for the context of functional safety in autonomous driving is that an embedded system is \"a system that is part of a larger system and performs some special purpose for that system (in contrast to a general-purpose part that is meant to be continuously configured to meet the demands of its users)\" [4]. Common in applications with embedded systems is the requirement for real-time interaction with the world. Several subjects areas assist in the systematic design of embedded systems for safety: safety engineering, systems engineering, formal methods, and software testing.\n\nApart from safety, also several ethical and legal matters need to be considered when driving decisions are provided by algorithms. An interesting dilemma is discussed in [5] regarding how an algorithm should choose between two evils. This includes cases such as whether the algorithm should decide to sacrifice the vehicle's passengers in order to save a greater number of other people, or should it decide to protect the passengers at all cost. The answer to such a question depends on moral and philosophical viewpoints that vary across societies and individuals. A new General Data Protection Regulation, summarized in [6], is planned to be enforced across the EU in 2018. In this law, the user should be able to obtain an explanation regarding an algorithmic decision made on his/her behalf.\n\nSeveral technologies are employed in the automotive industry and academia for monitoring the vehicle's environment, which include cameras, Radar, Lidar, and ultra-sonic sensors. The sensor data is fed to algorithms that support various functionalities, which may be of high relevance to safety. These algorithms may also be highly complex, making them difficult to analyze. The problem associated with using the sensor data for achieving the required functions is not possible to solve analytically for real world scenarios due to large input spaces (e.g. all combinations of pixel values). For such problems, solutions have emerged from the fields of Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and statistical signal processing. These approaches share a probabilistic paradigm. Depending on the method used, the probabilistic factors may or may not need to be explicitly treated when solving the problem. The answers are for some methods described in terms of probability distributions, while for other methods probabilistic factors affect the solution implicitly and are not indicated in the answers. This is especially the case with deep learning, where labeled data is used to train an artificial neural network to solve the problem. This thesis refers to systems utilizing probabilistic methods from these three fields as Learning Systems, and focuses explicitly on methods using supervised learning with labeled data used for training or statistical analysis.\n\nWhen automation is used to drive the vehicle, there are several possible points of failure in the system. These include hardware and software malfunction, problems with network delays/synchronization, mechanical problems, and also the behavior of the learning systems used. Investigating the safety impacts of these elements in the real world for autonomous driving can be infeasible and also dangerous. This motivates alternative methods that instead involve the use of simulations. Of relevance also is the ISO 26262 [7] standard, which covers functional safety for electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems in passenger vehicles, including software. This thesis focuses on the safety concerns with using learning systems in autonomous driving. The next section introduces the research questions that will be addressed.\n\n1.1 Research Questions\n\nThe research questions investigated in this thesis are stated as follows:\n\n1. What are the concerns when learning systems are used in safety critical applications, specifically in the pursuit of higher levels of autonomous driving (SAE level 3 and higher)?\n\n• Learning algorithms are affected by probabilistic factors inherent in their design. What are the concerns if we need to assure their safety in high-criticality automotive applications?\n\n• What are the implications when we need to comply with ISO 26262, specifically with regard to clauses 7 and 8 of part 3, which address hazard analysis, risk assessment, and the functional safety concept?\n\n2. Given the challenges with regards to safety-assurance of learning systems, what solutions can be considered?\n\n• What are the prominent formal methods approaches, and how can we assess their suitability for different applications? For example: is it helpful to use methods that verify mathematical properties of inputs and outputs for the learning system, or is it more appropriate to introduce other architectural elements, such as safety monitors, that address behavioral/functional properties?\n\n• Using an example deep learning system in a speed control application, how could we design a simple safety monitoring solution that is feasible for this scenario. Would the monitor design complexity present challenges?\n\n3. Due to cost and safety considerations for prototyping autonomous speed control systems in a physical environment, how can simulations assist in testing safety monitors and learning systems? What are the needed elements in the simulator to support safety studies of vision based learning systems? What commercial tools can we identify and test for this setup?\n\n1.2 Delimitations\n\nSome delimitations were made in order to better address the main focus of this work, while others had to be imposed due to limited project time and resources. Below is a list of the delimitations.\n\n• The aim in this project is to study safety concerns with (supervised) learning systems and how safety can be assured for an example automotive application. Designing a high performing learning system is not a primary objective, and could even defeat the purpose of our investigation. Beyond achieving basic performance for conducting experiments, optimizing performance can also use up excess project time, considering the limited computational resources available.\n\n• A discussion is presented regarding clauses 7 and 8 of the ISO 26262 part 3, which relate to hazard analysis and functional safety at the concept phase. Other parts of the standard are not discussed unless there is a need to reference them. The focus is on studying safety for learning systems at a conceptual level rather than undertaking product development activities.\n\n• Although a safety monitoring strategy is developed for the general scenario of combined longitudinal and lateral motion, only the simpler frontal collision avoidance monitoring is tested in simulations.\n\n• The approach presented in this thesis uses a model of the leading vehicle's expected future trajectory in collision avoidance. However, this is not addressed in any depth, and only the case of a fixed leading vehicle is considered.\n\n• Fault tolerance within the control system by incorporating sensor fusion using different types of sensors is not considered. Although the simplicity of the design presented in Section 4.2 could be criticized, the focus in this thesis is not on sensor solutions yielding high robustness and performance, but rather is on the fundamental safety challenges with learning systems, and handling faults at an architectural level.\n\n• A prototype vision-based speed control system will be developed in later sections. Imperfections in the image data due to noise, distortions, motion blur, are not incorporated, as this introduces unneeded variables to the study, and also increases computational demands in preparing experiments. The main interest is in the fundamental safety concerns when deploying learning systems in safety critical applications. Noise or imperfect data is a problem that is not specific to learning systems. Also for safety monitoring, the focus is on the functionality assuming perfect input information.\n\n• An example measure is discussed and tested as an indicator of the learning system's trustworthiness during operation. The development of better indicators, or the investigation of desired properties of such indicators has not been attempted in this work.\n\n1.3 Research Method\n\nTo address the goals for this thesis, literature is examined on relevant topics and a demo is built in a simulation environment. Relevant literature is identified on learning systems, especially with regard to safety and how the problem can be defined in the context of safety. Also, the types of learning systems that are most relevant in autonomous driving are identified, along with particular safety concerns with their use. The ISO 26262 is consulted for a recommendation on how to meet safety goals given the challenges with assuring the safety of learning systems. Literature is also examined on formal methods, and how they can fit into safety assurance for autonomous driving, beginning with the SMOF approach [8, 9] which is of interest at the Embedded Control Systems devision at KTH. The knowledge and experience gained is then demoed in a virtual vehicle simulation setup, and experiments are performed to further examine the safety concerns and seek insights.\n\n1.4 Thesis Outline\n\nThis thesis studies the safety concerns with learning systems delivering critical functionalities in autonomous driving, and investigates an architectural approach for meeting safety requirements. This section introduces the topic of safety in the context of autonomous driving, and the use of learning systems in safety-critical applications. Section 2 discusses the safety concerns, as well as the use of learning systems for autonomous driving. This is followed by a discussion of the ISO 26262 standard and the architectural approach to addressing safety is considered. Section 2.3 reviews the literature on safety monitoring and identifies a promising approach. Section 3 applies the safety monitoring approach to the context of collision avoidance. A case study is presented in Section 4, in which simulation is used to support safety studies of safety monitoring and control. The control system considered uses camera images as input, and utilizes deep learning. An indicator is presented for the trustworthiness of the learning system during operation. Experiments are then performed to study safety and test collision avoidance. Finally, Section 5 discusses and summarizes the work in this thesis, and offers suggestions for further research.\n\n1.5 Contributions\n\nThe contributions of this thesis are the following:\n\n• A discussion is made of the safety concerns with deploying learning systems in safety critical automotive applications in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. Safety monitoring approaches are also discussed along with their complexity considerations in Section 2.3.\n\n• Models for longitudinal as well as combined longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance scenarios are developed and used within a safety monitoring approach in Section 3.1.\n\n• An approach to safety distance calculation based on time varying relative acceleration models is presented in Section 3.2. Constant acceleration models are shown to offer relatively optimistic safety distances in comparison, which is not desirable.\n\n• The use of simulations for supporting safety studies of camera-based learning systems is discussed in Section 4.1, and three simulation tools, IPG CarMaker, TESIS DYNAware, and TASS PreScan are considered for this application.\n\n• A simulation-based approach is presented in Section 4.3 for performing safety studies with camera-based vehicle control, where a full control and safety toolchain can be tested. Experiments with malfunctioning behaviors in a vision-based speed control system are also presented. An architectural safety monitoring approach is applied and demonstrated for collision avoidance in case of hazardous speed control behavior.\n\n• An example runtime indicator is presented in Section 4.3.4, for the trustworthiness of a vision-based speed control system. Such an indicator can help warn in advance before severe safety interventions are needed.\n\n2 Background\n\nThis section presents the background relevant to the discussions of this thesis. A function approximation view of learning systems is introduced and used to discuss safety concerns. Applications for learning systems in autonomous driving are then discussed, with particular mention of the end-to-end approach to solving automation problems, and the safety implications that arise. The ISO 26262 is discussed for this context, and an architectural approach to safety is considered. Safety monitoring is then introduced, and a promising approach in the literature is identified.\n\nAlthough developments in automation may yield good performance, and even eliminate sources of human error, there are several sources of failures that introduce hazards. For the case where the automation systems employ learning algorithms, these sources can include unreliable sensors, problems with the data used for training, as well as limitations in the algorithms and faults in their design.\n\nWith regard to the learning systems addressed in this thesis, Vapnik [10] provides a definition that is helpful in this context. In Vapnik's paper, learning is posed as a problem of function approximation involving three components:\n\n1. A generator of random vectors x, drawn independently from a fixed but unknown distribution P (x).\n\n2. A supervisor which returns an output vector y to every input vector x, according to a conditional distribution function P (y|x), also fixed but unknown.\n\n3. A learning machine capable of implementing a set of functions f(x,w), where w ∈W is a set of parameters to be learned.\n\nTo illustrate these components in an example application, consider the case where a deep neural network classifies input images. The generator would be the training images used to train the network, with each image being a vector x in Vapnik's model. The supervisor would be the ground truth labeling process for the training images, where the class label is encoded in the output vector y referred to above. A commonly used distinction in machine learning literature is between supervised and unsupervised learning. In the former, ground truth labels are available, as is the case in our image classification example. With unsupervised learning on the other hand, ground truth labels are not available and other mechanisms are used. A key point is that P (y|x) is unknown, and in effect sampled for available x vectors. Finally, the implementation of the particular deep neural network architecture would constitute the learning machine. The term w refers to the network parameters such as the weights and biases. The resulting output of the neural network, depends on the input image x, and the network parameters w used, which are determined by the training process. The concept of learning systems discussed in this thesis uses this function approximation view of supervised learning. A discussion is presented in [11, 12] on the critical role of training data and loss functions, which represent training objectives, for the safety of machine learning systems. For the loss functions, the authors note that with quantities related to performance or prediction error, the human cost that is relevant for safety may not be accounted for. For example, consider the trivial scenario where the steering angle for a vehicle is learned by a neural network from labeled data. The quantities relevant for safety may include the risk of collision, and the risk of injury or death, which depend on the operating environment. If the backpropagation method is used with the angle error alone, these safety considerations are not incorporated in the loss function. Also, arguments based on laws of large numbers (e.g. average error) may not be suitable when considering safety, since safety-critical cases may be rare and underrepresented in an aggregate quantity. Two concerns are noted by the authors for the training data\n\n• The training samples may not be drawn from the underlying distribution, P (y|x). For the image classification example, consider the case when the training images are produced by ideal sensors, and contain no noise, distortions, or motion blur, but the actual P (y|x) needed for the application is for non-ideal realistic images. By using ideal training images, the training samples were drawn from a different distribution than P (y|x). In addition, the difference between the target distribution and the distribution from which training samples are drawn may not be easily understood or possible to account for.\n\n• The training samples are absent in parts of the x vector space. This can especially be the case for rare, low probability, x regions. Safety relevant rare conditions may be insufficiently represented, or not represented at all.\n\nThere may be other concerns the authors do not explicitly include, such as the formulation of the learning problem with adequate and suitable information to infer outputs. This can be viewed as sampling from P (y|z) when P (y|x) is the needed distribution for the problem. If the mapping between z and x is many-to-one, then simply extra training data would be needed. If the mapping is one-to-many, or many-to-many then nondeterminism is introduced, affecting the potential for inferring the output. Overfitting is another problem in supervised learning, which is related to the complexity of the learned system (e.g. the number of weights) relative to the amount of training data. A complex model can fit exactly a set of points that draw a straight line with an added noise, however, it will generalize very poorly on unseen data compared to a simple model for a straight line. This can be related to the discussion on the loss functions. When using only the error in the loss function, the complex model would be favored, however, an additional term can be incorporated to avoid overfitting by penalizing model complexity. This technique is known as regularization. Overfitting can also be related to causality and interpretability. The higher model complexity can allow for fitting noise and vagaries in the training data that are not part of the underlying physics, and also make the model more difficult to understand.\n\nThe authors suggest four strategies for improving safety:\n\n• Inherently Safe Design Causality and interpretability can be insisted on in the design of systems, which allows for the behavior of the models in response to inputs to be understood and verified. Irrelevant input and output variables need to be eliminated, to expose the main \"physics\" of the system governing its functional and safety properties. Interpretability refers to the possibility of understanding the models and their operation, for e.g. whether a model is black box, gray box, white box, etc. Interpretable models can much more easily be examined with respect to safety or other properties. The authors, do not include causality as a safety concern beside the training data and loss functions above, but it can contribute an offset between the target and training data distributions. For example, consider the case discussed in the previous paragraph regarding sampling from P (y|z) when P (y|x) is the needed instead.\n\n• Safety Reserves In [11, 12], this refers to optimizing not only with respect to the model parameters, but also with respect to uncertainties in training data. A practical example is not suggested, but the key is to consider the worst case outcome while varying uncertainties, whether due to training and test distribution mismatch or instantiation of the test set. It is also suggested to consider fairness and equitability, so that certain groups are not underrepresented for safety.\n\n• Safe Fail With this strategy, the system may elect a reject option, in which it does not attempt to predict the output for the given input sample. For example, in regions that are too close to decision boundaries, or regions that correspond to rare input conditions, a safe fail would be to ask the human operator to intervene.\n\n• Procedural Safeguards User experience design can help guide practitioners on how to correctly setup the machine learning system. This includes the training data set, evaluation procedures, and other elements. If automated design processes are performed by users who are not deeply knowledgeable of the systems and associated safety concerns, incorrect use can be a concern. Another procedural safeguard is to have the possibility of public audit of source code, so that potential problems can be discovered. Having the data source publicly available is also suggested by the authors.\n\nThe next section discusses some autonomous driving applications from the literature with regard to safety. Following this, the relevant safety standard for such applications is considered, and then the topic of safety monitoring is introduced.\n\n2.1 Safety Issues When Using Learning Systems for Autonomous Driving\n\nA pioneering work in this area is [13] from 1989, where a neural network computes the steering angle for a vehicle using camera and laser rangefinder inputs. This approach later came to be called end-to-end learning, since the algorithms are not hand designed. After the introduction of convolutional neural networks (CNN), end-to-end learning was utilized in a famous project by LeCun et al. [14], to drive a model truck on unknown open terrain while avoiding obstacles. More recently, advancements have been made in CNNs for vision tasks, which were driven by improvements in computational resources and network designs with more hidden layers. Networks with large amount of layers are referred to as \"deep\" networks in the literature, with the corresponding phrase \"deep learning\" also used. [15] used Deep CNN for end-to-end steering in lane and road following.\n\nThe main attraction with the end-to-end approach is that no domain expertise is required on how the system should solve the problem. Although some expertise would be required for selecting a suitable training data set and loss functions for the problem, the process for solving the problem is inferred implicitly from data.\n\nRelating to the interpretability concept mentioned earlier, end-to-end systems can be viewed as uninterpretable, black box, computations. Consider that solving the main problem controlling a vehicle using vision information consists of several logical subproblems, such as: lane tracking, scene understanding, vehicle state awareness, coordinating with other vehicles, action policy, and others. The logic of how an end-to-end system solves the main problem is not understood, neither is the correctness of the solutions to each logical subproblem. This presents a safety concern in its own right, and compounds the previously mentioned challenges regarding adequate training data.\n\nFor safety, training data needs to cover rare cases that exercise all logical subsystems of an end-to-end system. To illustrate the challenge, consider a problem composed of two subproblems: PA and PB. Since with end-to-end systems the solutions to the subproblems are not inspected separately, faults in one subproblem may be masked in the aggregate system. Consider fault FA which affects the solution to PA. Due to a masking affect, this particular fault may not always be detected in the aggregate system. Rather than requiring simply that the training data accounts for FA, in an end-to-end system the data needs to exercise FA such that it is detectable in the aggregate system. The rarity of needed data could be much higher than if subproblems could be inspected separately. As the complexity of problems increases for end-to-end systems, it becomes increasingly harder to alleviate safety concerns associated with adequate training data.\n\nAnalytical methods for verification of properties of deep networks have been proposed in the literature [16, 17]. However, these methods use a mathematical view of the system's inputs and outputs, where one needs to specify safety properties concerning the values of input pixels and output quantities. Even if this could be achieved, the likely complex methods required for deriving such specifications would need verification efforts of their own.\n\nNext, a brief discussion is presented of some relevant portions of the ISO 26262 safety standard, in relation to safety critical autonomous driving applications.\n\n2.2 The ISO 26262 Standard\n\nAs the automotive industry aims at higher levels of automation, there is a trend of increasing complexity in the various software, hardware, and mechatronic systems deployed in vehicles. Due to the challenges in scaling the safety assurance with system complexity, as well as the critical application areas involved, safety becomes increasingly a major issue. The ISO 26262 [7] standard addresses the functional safety of electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems within road vehicles, which for example include systems for: driver assistance, propulsion, and vehicle dynamics control. Safety requirements can be at the technical or functional level. Technical safety requirements pertain to safety of systems at the technical implementation level, and can for example include: voltage limits, memory requirements, speed ranges, safety distances, reaction times, etc. Functional safety requirements, on the other hand is implementation-independent, and relates to a higher level of abstraction which addresses behaviors of systems in response to inputs. This can involve, for example: actuator actions, computational flow within software, and transitions across system states. For functional safety, the system as a whole needs to be considered, along with the environment in which it operates.\n\nThe aim in the ISO 26262 is to assure the absence of unreasonable risk due to hazards caused by malfunctioning behavior of E/E systems, including software. The standard provides an automotive safety lifecycle, with a framework for the elimination of hazards and minimizing residual risk. The Safety Integrity Level is an important concept in the standard, pertaining to the amount of rigor in safety requirements that would be suitable for the amount of risk involved. Also, requirements for validation of safety and for relations with suppliers are addressed in the ISO 26262.\n\nAn overview of the ISO 26262 is shown in Figure 1. For the safety studies of learning systems presented in this thesis, the clauses in the standard which are most relevant are clauses 7 and 8 of part 3, addressing hazard analysis and functional safety at the concept phase of product development. The focus of this work is on the fundamental concerns with the use of learning systems. Safety within management, product development, and production activities is not of direct relevance, and is hence not discussed.\n\nFigure 1: ISO 26262 overview [7]. Copyright remains with ISO (used with permission).\n\n2.2.1 Hazard analysis, risk assessment and ASIL determination\n\nIn the ISO 26262, the term \"item\" is used to refer to a system or array of systems that implements a function at the vehicle level, and to which the standard is applied. The item of interest in the investigations presented in this thesis can be defined as the autonomous driving function achieved via learning systems, without specifying any particular choice of learning systems, or the type of input and interfaces they involve. An example of such an item discussed in Section 4 is a speed control system using a deep neural network vision system. That item takes camera images of the road as input, and outputs brake and acceleration levels.\n\nDuring hazard analysis and risk assessment the item is evaluated without internal safety mechanisms, with regard to its potential hazardous events (i.e. combinations of hazards and operational situations). Hazards that can result also from foreseeable misuse shall be analyzed. The hazards that can be triggered by malfunctions in the item are identified, and safety goals for the prevention or mitigation of the hazardous events are formulated.\n\nThe standard requires for hazards to be determined systematically. Some hazard analysis techniques mentioned in the standard are Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Hazardous events and their associated safety goals are assigned Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs), which are determined according to an assessment of the severity, probability of exposure, and controllability of the hazards. Figure 2 shows the classification classes for these factors.\n\nFigure 2: ISO 26262 classification of hazardous events [7].\n\nExposure and controllability assessments use estimates for the probability of exposure to hazardous situations, and the probability of avoiding harm, respectively. For classes E1-E4 and C1-C3, the difference in probability from one class to the next is an order of magnitude. It has been suggested in [18] to avoid probabilistic assessments as they bring in subjectivity for assumptions and analyses about the system, and that ASIL assessment entails a tension between safety and business competitiveness considerations for manufacturers. The assignment of ASIL in the standard using the severity, exposure, and controllability classes is shown in Figure 3.\n\nIn the collision avoidance scenarios discussed in this thesis, the hazard represents a situation where the vehicle may collide with obstacles due to failures in control functionalities achieved via learning systems. The corresponding safety goal is to avoid colliding with obstacles due to malfunctioning vehicle control from learning systems. Collisions can lead to fatal injuries, which are not avoidable without safety measures. This requires severity class S3, and a controllability class C3 classifications. Exposure refers to the relative frequency of exposure to the possibility of the hazard occurring. For example, hazardous events related to airbags have low exposure since airbags rarely deploy, while hazardous events related to braking systems have high exposure as braking is relevant in many driving situations. For example, an omission failure or braking, is relevant and dangerous in many driving situations - thus having high exposure. In the context of safety critical learning systems used in autonomous driving, the exposure is high when essential driving functions are automated. This would require an exposure classification of E4. The ASIL that results from these severity, exposure, and controllability classifications is an ASIL D. Furthermore, a challenge when using use a data-driven design process rather than analytic methods, is the presence of not only known unknown factors, but also unknown unknowns that are difficult to account for in probability assessment.\n\nFigure 3: ASIL assignment in ISO 26262 [7]\n\nThe ISO 26262-9:2011, Clause 5, offers an opportunity to implement safety requirements by independent architectural elements, and assign a potentially lower ASIL to the decomposed safety requirements. This is referred to as ASIL decomposition. For learning systems whose safety is difficult to analyze and verify, it can be desirable to divert away safety compliance efforts to simpler architectural elements that achieve the safety goals. For the ASIL D safety goal of avoiding collisions due to learning systems' functions, Clause 5.4.10, allows a decomposition into one ASIL D(D) requirement and one QM(D) requirement. The class QM (quality management) denotes that complying with the standard is not required. The ASIL QM(D) can be assigned to the learning system responsible for the autonomous driving functions, while an ASIL D(D) requirement can be assigned to a dedicated safety monitor for which it is simpler to assure safety compliance.\n\n2.2.2 Functional safety concept\n\nClause 8 of ISO 26262-3 addresses the functional safety concept, which involves the allocation of functional safety requirements to architectural elements of the item, or to external measures. With the safety goal of avoiding collisions stated earlier decomposed into one ASIL D(D) requirement and one QM(D) requirement, an architectural element can be introduced to satisfy the ASIL D(D) requirement, while the original learning system can be exempt from needing to comply with the standard. The ASIL D(D) safety requirement can simply be to avoid colliding with obstacles. The added architectural element for this requirement can be considered as a safety monitor or a collision avoidance system.\n\nThe exact definition for this system would vary with implementation and technology choices, including the type of sensors used and the available system outputs. ASIL decomposition helps to divert safety assurance efforts from the complex systems that employ learning systems. However, complexity in the safety monitoring device can also increase verification efforts and should be minimized.\n\nIn this thesis, safety is addressed not by attempting to verify the safety properties of learning systems, and not by employing strategies that foster safety within learning systems. Instead, the idea is for safety concerns to be diverted to a separate architectural component for achieving the needed safety goals, whose verification is much simpler. Safety monitoring is considered for applications where the learning system drives the vehicle. Only accidents associated with colliding with obstacles are addressed, for which case collision avoidance is of relevance, and safety monitoring should achieve this function.\n\n2.3 The Safety Monitoring Approach to Safety\n\nSafety monitoring is not a new paradigm, although other terms have also been used to describe the approach. An early work in this area is [19] from 1987, which shows a formal methods approach that generates a supervisor from a system model and a constraint model both expressed as automata. The supervisor issues inhibitions to prevent hazardous actions. An example offered is when two users should not simultaneously access a shared resource. The objective would be to inhibit transitions in order to satisfy synchronization requirements. The authors provide a formal approach to proving that the needed supervisor exists, and that the corresponding synthesis problem is solvable.\n\nAutomated tools have been developed for verifying properties of automata models, known as model checkers. Model checkers exhaustively check the reachable states of the model. If the property holds, the model checker confirms it with full certainty, and provides some diagnostic information otherwise. Model checking has been used in the design of safety monitors. Siminiceanu and Ciardo [20] use their SMART model checker to verify the design and expose potential problems with the NASA airport runway safety monitor, which detects incursions and alert pilots.\n\nWith increasing complexity in system behavior and its environment, more descriptive models become needed, and their state space size increases. This presents a scalability challenge when using model checkers, since all the reachable states need to be checked. This is referred to as the \"state space explosion\" problem. In [20], the popular NuSMV and SPIN model checkers were found not feasible for the runway safety monitoring application with a large state space.\n\nOne other consideration is that embedded systems exhibit both event-driven and time-driven phenomena. To represent such systems, hybrid models are used which include both discrete and continuous variables. Model checkers for hybrid systems exist, notably [21], however the computational complexity in model checking hybrid models is larger than for discrete models, which present further scalability difficulties. In applications where an implicitly discrete view of time and other continuous variables is used (e.g. due to sampling and quantization), it can be suitable to use discrete models.\n\nRuntime verification is another paradigm related to model checking. Rather than using a model checker to verify the safety monitor offline, the safety monitor checks the execution of the system online. In effect, not all possible system executions are exhaustively checked, but only those that are encountered during system operation. This provides a fault detection mechanism. A key difference with model checking is that no model for the system is needed. A runtime verification architecture is proposed in [3] for safety-critical embedded systems. In this approach, execution traces are analyzed during system operation and checked against formal specifications. A separate controller is then triggered if a violation occurs. The focus of this work is more on the technical level, relating to the technical operation of systems. An example offered by the author is the following: \"If the brake pedal has been pressed, then within 200ms cruise control should be disengaged for 100ms.\"\n\nFor collision avoidance, the top level safety goal is at the functional level, relating to the behavior of the vehicle within its environment. For complex scenarios, model checking can help ensure that this goal is achieved by the safety monitor, also if using runtime verification.\n\nThe work presented in this thesis will use the SMOF safety monitoring framework where the supervisor issues interventions, following [8, 9]. In this SMOF approach, the state space is partitioned into safe, warning, and critical regions. The safety monitor triggers interventions upon the system entering the warning regions to insure that transitions into critical regions are prevented. The authors also present an automated tool for the identification of warning states, and the synthesis of safety strategies given the available interventions. The main promise in the SMOF tool is the capability to produce a safety monitor given a system and a set of available interventions.\n\n2.3.1 Application to Collision Avoidance\n\nCollision avoidance (CA) requires not only the abstract safety rules that can be obtained with SMOF, but also the implementation of these rules. This includes detection and tracking of obstacles, and the needed planning and action steps for avoiding a collision. An overview of collision avoidance systems is found in [22]. It is noted that collision avoidance per se is not always attainable in automotive applications, and collision mitigation is a more realistic focus, i.e. reducing the severity of accidents. One main challenge, is defining the conditions in which the CA system should intervene. The author suggests examples where vehicles meet in a narrow road allowing little separation, and overtaking maneuvers that can be confused with imminent dangers. These challenges present a trade-off between effectiveness and unneeded interventions. Also, the work compares steering and braking maneuvers in terms of efficiency. For avoiding a head-on collision, with constant acceleration models the author shows that the needed separation distance is much higher with braking than steering as the initial speed increases. In fact, it was shown that with constant acceleration models, the separation distance is proportional to the square of velocity for braking, but linearly proportional to velocity for steering. The concept of \"decision functions\" is also presented in [22], in which dynamic models of the ego and other vehicles, as well as assumptions of future actions are basis for CA intervention decisions. Constant velocity and constant acceleration dynamic models are presented for estimating future trajectories. Several measures have been discussed for assessing the corresponding collision threat, including: distance, time to collision, closest point of approach, required acceleration, and others.\n\nThis thesis will present a different approach for integrating the two components, which is in alignment with the SMOF approach. Rather than using constant acceleration models, an approach will be shown involving time varying acceleration models for calculating the needed safety distance dynamically at run time, rather than only indicating a threat level or warning. This framework also allows for flexibility in defining the expectation of future actions of obstacles, which can be of help with the previously mentioned confusing scenarios (meeting at narrow roads and overtaking). However, this is not within the scope of this thesis and is not presented. In the following section, the main methodology is presented along with an example.\n\n3 Safety Monitoring for Collision Avoidance\n\nThis section applies the SMOF safety monitoring approach to the context collision avoidance, both for the longitudinal (front and back) and lateral (sideways) cases. Next, the problem is formulated and the SMOF rule synthesis tool is tested with models for the two cases. The latter case will involve a much larger state space. After obtaining safety rules, the technical implementation of these rules is addressed.\n\n3.1 SMOF for Collision Avoidance\n\nIn the SMOF framework, the safety system is responsible for monitoring safety and triggering interventions when the system transitions into a warning state. A formal description of the problem is presented next, but the reader may skip to Section 3.1.1 for an implementation of this approach. In the SMOF framework, the tasks may be viewed as follows:\n\n1. Let the vehicle's surrounding regions be represented by a set of nondeterministic finite state machines (FSMs) Ri, i = 1, 2, 3, ...n, each possessing its own set of states Si, generators Σi, and\n\ntransition relations −→i with which jointly the FSMs satisfy constraints related to interdependency of different regions. Let the joint system be denoted by T = {R1, R2, R3, ..., Rn} with the space of possible states S, transition relations −→, and generators Σ. Given a catastrophic combination of the sets Sc ∈ S, obtain the set of predecessor warning states Sw\n\nSw = Pre(Sc) := { sw ∈ S : ∃σ ∈ Σ,∃sc ∈ Sc, sw σ−→ sc\n\n} .\n\n2. Specify the available monitor interventions that if associated to warning states sw ∈ Sw transitions into catastrophic states can be possibly canceled. This can also be viewed as introducing an additional FSM (the monitor), so that the joint system can have no catastrophic states. Let the monitor be given by M(Sm,Σm,−→m), T′ = {M,T} denotes the joint system with the monitor. The monitor's states are derived from the states of Ri through a function F . In other words, Sm = F (S1, S2, S3, ..., Sn). To cancel catastrophic transitions some dependency has to exist also between the generators of Ri and the monitor's generators. The task at this step is to suggest the monitor's state derivations and generators, such that a cancellation of catastrophic transitions can be possible.\n\n3. Find the possible mappings between the available monitor interventions and the warning states sw ∈ Sw such that the catastrophic states are no longer reachable. In the FSM view of the monitor, we need to now find the transition relation such that @σm ∈ Σm, sc ∈ Sc that satisfy F−1(sm) σm−−→m sc. In the Joint system, the critical states are unreachable.\n\nReferring back to the collision avoidance problem, the vehicle's autonomous driving systems contribute an additional actor P to T′. Its states that are relevant to safety are contained in the space of possible states for the system with no monitor Sp ⊂ S, but the generators Σ and transition relations −→ of T are pessimistically unconstrained by those of P .\n\nIn a comprehensive collision avoidance scenario, the vehicle's surrounding regions need to be considered longitudinally to avoid collisions from the front and back, laterally to avoid collisions from the sides, as well as possibly under the vehicle to avoid tires running on hazardous objects below. The boundaries for the zones depend on the possibilities for hazards and monitor interventions, and must be chosen such that intervention specifications are implementable. This thesis will next discuss a longitudinal collision avoidance model, and build up to a model for combined longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance.\n\n3.1.1 Longitudinal Collision Avoidance\n\nFor the longitudinal case, an occupancy grid is considered in the form shown in Figure 4, consisting of safe, warning and critical regions. The boundaries of the regions, in terms of both shape and distance, are beyond the scope of SMOF, and are treated separately as technical specifications.\n\nIn the figure, the critical region isRc, and the two warning regions areRf andRb, which respectively represent the front and back of the vehicle. With this simple model, the possibilities for obstacles to emerge into the critical region from below, or descend from above are not supported.\n\nFigure 4: Occupancy grid for longitudinal model\n\nThe occupancy state of each warning region is modeled using a finite state machine, shown in Figure 5. The state begins with the region empty, and can become occupied if an object approaches. After which, the object may either continue to approach, or become relatively stationary. At this point, the status cannot change to empty before the object departs first.\n\nFigure 5: Finite state machine representation of region status\n\nThe SMOF tool uses a template NuSMV model that includes a model of the system, and a model of accident causality. The occupancy FSM was implemented as a NuSMV module and instantiated in two variables representing the Rf and Rb regions. The accident model used defines an accident as an approaching state for two consecutive time steps in any region.\n\nThe tool identified the seven expected warning states:\n\n• an approach in Rf , with empty, stationary, or departing Rb\n\n• an approach in Rb, with empty, stationary, or departing Rf\n\n• an approach in both Rf and Rb\n\nThe next step is to suggest interventions that can be used to synthesize safety strategies. The two obvious interventions for longitudinal collision avoidance would be to brake and to accelerate. The technical specification of interventions, as for physical boundaries of regions and time step, are beyond the scope of the SMOF methodology, and are to be addressed separately. However, the interventions suggested must be implementable for any resulting safety strategies to be viable. Braking is defined, at this stage, as simply braking sufficiently such that if a frontal approach occurs it does not persist in the next time step. The accelerate intervention is defined also in a similar way, assuming suitable technical implementation.\n\nThe brake and accelerate interventions are not adequate in the case of approaching states simultaneously in the two regions. As would be expected, the SMOF tool fails to find a safety strategy. To demonstrate the tool's synthesis capability, a third intervention has been added to allow for the possibility of avoiding accidents by transferring control to other systems or the driver. This could be criticized due to the various implementation challenges with such an intervention. Notwithstand- ing, the transfer control intervention is assumed to be viable, and used simply to demonstrate safety strategy synthesis with SMOF.\n\nThe tool identifies four strategies. The expected strategy has been found, as shown below, while the other three strategies involve transferring control also when not approached simultaneously from the front and back.\n\n• brake following a frontal approach\n\n• accelerate following a backward approach\n\n• transfer control following simultaneously both a forward and backward approach\n\nThis example demonstrates the SMOF approach and tool, where the safety monitoring rules are produced automatically according to user supplied models. The next section develops a model for combined longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance.\n\n3.1.2 Longitudinal and Lateral Collision Avoidance\n\nIn this combined scenario, the lateral motion is accounted for in addition to the longitudinal motion modeled in the previous section, as well as the interaction between the two. This allows the following possibilities not available in the previous case:\n\n• With awareness of the lateral dimension, collisions from the sides may also be avoided, rather than only the front and back.\n\n• The safety distance needed can be lower if collisions can be avoided with steering, or both steering and longitudinal control.\n\nAs was previously noted, specification of region boundaries, the time step, as well as the technical implementation of interventions is beyond the scope of the SMOF approach. The occupancy grid considered is shown in Figure 6, with in addition to the Rf and Rb regions, the left and right regions Rl and Rr are included. The possibility for lower safety distance due to steering is not aimed at in this model, as it would require being able to differentiate between the left and right regions within both Rf and Rb (for example, steering left does not avoid obstacles at the front-left direction). This would require additional variables, and result in a larger state space. As was noted previously, state space explosion is a major concern with model checking.\n\nFigure 6: Occupancy grid for combined longitudinal and lateral model\n\nUsing the same set of states as before, one way to model the combined longitudinal and lateral motion is to simply enumerate all possible combinations. For the longitudinal model, one region was described using four states. Lateral motion can be described similarly using the same four states. The number of combinations is 16. The number of transitions to set would then be 16 × 16 = 256. This approach was not pursued, although it is the obvious way. Instead, the previous model in Figure 5 was adapted with one instance used for each of the longitudinal and lateral motions within a region. Then, a few constraints were imposed to model the dependencies between lateral and longitudinal states within a region.\n\nEach warning region is described by two FSMs of the form shown in Figure 7, one for the longitudinal and another for the lateral states.\n\nFigure 7: Finite state machine representation of longitudinal/lateral components\n\nCompared to the previous FSM, now all transitions are possible, due to motion from the other direction. To account for the interdependencies between the two FSMs, the following constraints are added (⇐⇒ and =⇒ denote logical equivalence and implication, respectively)\n\n• empty laterally ⇐⇒ empty longitudinally\n\n• longitudinally stationary or departing without previous approach =⇒ lateral approach\n\n• longitudinally approaching and previously departing =⇒ lateral approach (previous object exited and new one entered)\n\n• longitudinally empty and previously stationary or approaching =⇒ previous lateral depart\n\n• laterally stationary or departing without previous approach =⇒ longitudinal approach\n\n• laterally approaching and previously departing =⇒ longitudinal approach\n\n• laterally empty and previously stationary or approaching =⇒ previous longitudinal depart\n\nFirst the SMOF approach was attempted only with two regions, Rf and Rr. Accidents can be caused either by continuous longitudinal approach from the front, or continuous lateral approach from the right. The tool identified 51 warning states, which comprise of cases with either a frontal longitudinal approach, or a right lateral approach.\n\nTwo interventions were then used: braking and left steering. As explained in the previous section, the technical implementation of the interventions is not covered in the SMOF approach. Braking is defined as previously: decelerating sufficiently such that if a frontal approach occurs it does not persist in the next time step. Left steering is defined in a similar way with no reference to implementation. The tool finds the expected strategy:\n\n• brake following a frontal longitudinal approach\n\n• steer left following a right lateral approach\n\n• brake and steer left following a simultaneous frontal longitudinal approach and right lateral approach\n\nThis successfully demonstrates the SMOF tool for a more complex application than previously seen in Section 3.1.1. Next, the two missing regions were added, namely the back and left regions, and the accident model was correspondingly extended. The SMOF tool was found unfortunately not feasible even in computing the warning states for the full model.\n\nAlthough the tool has not been of assistance, this does not preclude using the SMOF architecture. Two additional interventions were added for acceleration and right steering, and a further transfer control intervention was added, following Section 3.1.1. A strategy was proposed manually and checked with NuSMV:\n\n• brake if not longitudinally approached from the back and either approached longitudinally from the front or trapped laterally\n\n• accelerate if not braking, and not longitudinally approached from the front and either approached longitudinally from the back or trapped laterally\n\n• steer left if not laterally approached from the left and either approached laterally from the right or trapped longitudinally\n\n• steer right if not steering left, and not laterally approached from the right and either approached laterally from the left or trapped longitudinally\n\n• transfer control if trapped longitudinally, and trapped laterally\n\nwhere \"trapped\" refers to when having obstacles in two opposite regions, i.e. front and back for longitudinal, while left and right for lateral trapping. In order to avoid conflicts when two opposing interventions are possible, preference is given to braking and left steering.\n\nIn the preceding sections, the SMOF tool has been demonstrated for the simple scenario of longitudinal collision avoidance, and for a more complex scenario with frontal and rightwards collision avoidance incorporating two dimensional motion. Although the tool suffered from the state space problem when applied to an even more complex model, a solution could be model checked successfully, allowing for the use of SMOF safety strategies. The main components in the SMOF approach is the partitioning of the state space to identify warning states, and the use of safety strategies, that when needed enact interventions to prevent transitions to critical states. These were achieved in all the cases considered in the previous sections. The following section examines the technical implementation aspects that need to be addressed.\n\n3.2 Safety Distance Using Time-Varying Acceleration Models\n\nGiven predicted relative acceleration â(t) between the ego vehicle and the object (e.g. a leading/trailing vehicle), and initial relative speed v0, the task is to obtain the initial separation x0 that avoids a trajectory reaching 0 distance, if this is possible for â(t) and v0. The main result is derived in Appendix A, and stated as: ∫ 0\n\nx0\n\nâ(t)dx = −1 2 v20 (1)\n\nEquation 1 gives a relation between initial velocity and required separation for time-varying acceleration. An analytic solution requires an expression for the relative acceleration a(t) in terms of x, which is not available. Alternatively, a solution can be found numerically as will be shown in the next section. For the constant acceleration case the equation reduces to x0 =\n\nv20\n\n2ac\n\n(2)\n\nwhere ac is the constant acceleration.\n\nTo demonstrate a numerical approach to finding the needed separation distance in terms of initial relative speed, consider that the object moves towards the ego vehicle according to predicted acceleration curve ai(t), which is initially positive but decreases as the other object reacts to the situation, and consider that the ego vehicle is capable of acceleration profile as(t) in collision avoidance. For this example, assume that the two functions are of the form\n\nai(t) = R\n\n(\n\n2\n\n1 − tanh(t)\n\n)\n\nas(t) = −ksR tanh(αs t).\n\nR is the expected possible acceleration range in m/s2. The hyperbolic tangent has been used simply due to its shape containing transient and steady-state regions. A value of 4.3403 corresponds to 0-100km/hour in 6.4 seconds. ks is a scale factor representing the amount by which the magnitude of the ego vehicle's reaction is larger than the object's reaction, and αs represents the relative quickness in responding to the situation.\n\nLet us use: R = 0.5, ks = 1.5, αs = 0.5 as example. The resulting functions are shown in Figure 8, with also the relative acceleration â(t) = ai(t) + as(t) plotted.\n\nFigure 8: Time varying accelerations of the two objects\n\nThese simple models contain two phases: a transient response and a steady-state response. This assumes that the steady-state (of acceleration) continues indefinitely, implying that no reduction in deceleration occurs, and that collision avoidance efforts can persist as long as needed. However, in practice the relative acceleration may eventually go to zero, as would be the case with braking leading to a stopped vehicle.\n\nThe relative distance trajectory x(t) is found by integrating the acceleration twice:\n\nd2x(t) dt2 = dv(t) dt\n\n= â(t)\n\nv(t) =\n\n∫ t â(τ)dτ + v0\n\nx(t) =\n\n∫ t\n\n0 ∫ γ\n\n0 0\n\nâ(τ)dτdγ + v0t+ x0.\n\nwhere v0 is the initial approach (relative) speed. For any v0, we can find the least separation (least negative x0) that ensures x(t) > 0, ∀t > 0. By iterating over different approach speeds we can obtain a relation between v0 and x0.\n\nA speed of 40km/hour corresponds to 11.12m/s. Let us consider approach speeds in the range [0.1,11.12]. Figure 9 shows the least separation solutions for the different initial speeds v0. Notice that trajectories are always non positive for all the curves. Arriving at zero separation indicates that the initial separation is minimal. Due to the prolonged steady-state acceleration seen in Figure 8, the trajectory reverses after reaching zero separation (objects just touch then separate). The trajectory after zero separation is not of relevance for collision avoidance, and can be ignored.\n\nFigure 9: Solution trajectories for different initial speeds v0\n\nFinally a relation between v0 and x0 can be obtained, as shown in Figure 10.\n\nFigure 10: v0 to x0 relation\n\nLet us now consider the constant acceleration case to find how the required initial separation distance compares to the result in Figure 10. It is not apparent how one should select a value of ac in Equation 2. As example, consider the steady-state, average, median, and 25th percentile accelerations during the initial 10 seconds. Figure 11 shows the results for these constant estimates obtained by invoking Equation 2, together with the time-varying acceleration result.\n\nFigure 11: v0 to x0 relation for constant acceleration\n\nOptimistic separation distances were found for all the constant acceleration cases. The steady-state (minimum) acceleration yielded the most optimistic separation, as would be expected. The median is the acceleration at 5s in Figure 8, which is very close to the steady state. The 25th percentile is 2.5s in the figure. The average is the most conservative but still gives optimistic separation distance. These results indicate the significance of the initial period where the approach speed is high but little deceleration is taking place.\n\nIn the approach presented in this section, collisions can be avoided if the separation is greater than the obtained safety distance value. This gives the distance boundary needed in the SMOF approach, for interventions to be viable. The calculation uses relative motion in one direction. The boundary can be constructed along any direction of interest provided the following are available along that direction:\n\n• Current speed of approach between ego vehicle and object\n\n• Knowledge of ego vehicle's acceleration capability\n\n• Expectation for future acceleration of the object\n\nOnce the object is within this physical boundary, interventions can be triggered according to the safety strategies used.\n\nNext in this thesis, a case study is presented which employs simulation to test and demonstrate SMOF safety monitoring for collision avoidance. The main motivation in this work is safety assurance for learning systems. The study will deploy a vision-based autonomous driving function, along with safety monitoring using the approach discussed thus far.\n\n4 Case Study: Safety Monitoring for Vision-Based Vehicle Control\n\nThis section presents an implementation of safety monitoring and vehicle control toolchains within a simulation environment. A deep learning system will be used to drive a simulated vehicle, and experiments will be performed to investigate safety with malfunctioning vehicle control.\n\nPrevious sections have discussed the safety concerns with learning systems in autonomous driving, and the difficulty of verifying their safety properties. Instead, an architectural safety monitoring approach is pursued in this thesis. Section 3.1 applied the SMOF safety monitoring approach to collision avoidance, and Section 3.2 discussed an approach for obtaining the distance boundary needed for interventions to be viable. This section studies a case where a learning system controls the vehicle, and develops a framework for supporting safety investigations. The scenario consists of a vision-based speed control system for longitudinal motion, along with a collision avoidance safety system to mitigate risks due to faults in the learning system.\n\nDriving simulators are of help in this study, both for generating synthetic data, and for testing the effectiveness of safety systems. The experimental approach depends greatly on the capabilities offered by the driving simulator, and computational resources available. This topic is addressed next, after which the control toolchain and the experiments are presented.\n\n4.1 Driving Simulation\n\nThe motivation for using driving simulators in this study is that they can offer the possibility to experiment with driving scenarios that are difficult, and costly, to create in a real environment. For example, factors that make real-world experiments prohibitive are: access to vehicles and needed hardware, ensuring tests are safe, needing to perform system identification or measure relevant parameters, setting up prototype autonomous driving systems, the time to set up and conduct experiments, and also the difficulty of setting up controlled experiments when relevant variables cannot be controlled. With driving simulators, it is possible to work at a higher level of abstraction focusing more closely on the learning and safety systems at the functional level. The driving environment can be interfaced with system models as part of a software-in-the-loop or model-in-the-loop setup, which helps in evaluating functional safety.\n\nSpecifically for this vision-based speed control study, the elements needed in a driving simulator are the following.\n\n• off-line data export The quantities that are relevant to training need to be available for off-line use. These include: image frames, distance traveled by ego vehicle, distances to other vehicles of interest, acceleration and brake pedal positions, simulation time, as well as any other interesting information for training.\n\n• closed loop control To pursue control in a dynamic virtual world environment, there needs to be a possibility for using the above quantities in a closed loop setup where data is processed and control is sent to the vehicle during simulation. This can require synchronization between several simulation software components and user models.\n\n• adequate virtual world A basic level of scientific accuracy is needed in the simulation environment. This includes the physics of the vehicles within the environment, and also the visual appearance of virtual world.\n\nThree virtual driving simulators have been tried to assess their potential to support vision-based control studies: IPG CarMaker, TESIS DYNA4, and TASS PreScan. These simulators are discussed in the following subsections.\n\n4.1.1 IPG CarMaker\n\nCarMaker is a virtual testing platform for passenger cars and light-duty vehicles. The simulator can be interfaced with the MATLAB/Simulink environment using CarMaker's provided templates that include S-function blocks. The user's control strategies can be implemented either by manipulating Simulink signals or by creating custom modules. CarMaker can be run either stand-alone, or in cosimulation with Simulink.\n\nCarMaker offers possibilities for offline data export. After simulations, image frames can be obtained from the animation tool either by exporting video frames, or by exporting a video. However, timestamps are not available if the image frames are exported directly. The data plotting tool, IPG-Control, can be used for exporting simulation variables into a csv file. To capture data, IPGControl needs to be configured before simulations.\n\nExcept for a camera feed, all our needed quantities can be used directly in a closed loop setup within Simulink. IPG offers the Video Data Stream (VDS) extension package which allows sending video out of the animation tool via TCP, and includes some additional features for adding camera noise, motion blur, etc. This feature was not included in my initial trail, and had to be requested specifically. Using the additional visual features greatly reduces simulation and movie export speeds. Once a camera is configured within CarMaker, the animation tool, which is a separate program, sends out the video stream via TCP. After making several attempts to receive the video in Simulink using different approaches, at best the received images contained some distortions/artifacts, and the animation tool did not synchronize successfully with Simulink.\n\nAs for other factors, CarMaker meets the needs adequately with regards to scientific accuracy of the simulations and visual appearance of the virtual world.\n\n4.1.2 TESIS DYNAware DYNA4\n\nDYNA4 is simulation framework aimed at supporting vehicle development processes, and runs within Simulink, allowing for signals to be accessed and manipulated. Users can also configure and add new Simulink modules from within DYNA4.\n\nTo export data for offline use, one can select the needed quantities before the simulation, and then a mat file with needed variables is produced after its completion. DYNA4 stores the data needed to recreate the animation after simulations. Video can then be played back or exported, for any completed simulation.\n\nData signals are available for closed loop control, however, in the commercially available DYNA4 product camera pixels are not accessible in Simulink. TESIS kindly allowed me the opportunity to test a development version which includes this functionality. To obtain the camera feed for closed loop control, the camera is configured within DYNA4, and a receiver block is added to the corresponding Simulink model of the simulation project. A blocking communication is setup between the animation tool and Simulink, allowing for pixel data be accessed simply.\n\nDYNA4 offers a visually appealing animation which can support our vision-based control investigation, as well as an adequately accurate virtual world.\n\n4.1.3 TASS PreScan\n\nPrescan offers a simulation framework for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Intelligent Vehicle (IV) systems, targeted more for the simulation of sensors and the virtual environment, rather that vehicle dynamics. Simulink is also used as a simulation engine. After the scenario is configured in a GUI tool, a Simulink model is generated. ADAS functions can be implemented simply by modifying the generated models. Also, a wide variety of demos are provided featuring different ADAS functions, allowing for users to substitute their own algorithms. Sensor technologies such as radar, laser, camera, ultrasonic, GPS and C2C/C2I communications, are supported. A physics-based camera model is also available, which accounts for a complete pipeline from light sources to optics and final image.\n\nOne notable aspect with PreScan is its strong integration with MATLAB and Simulink, allowing for a lot of possibilities for accessing signals and controlling various elements of the virtual world, e.g. all simulation vehicles, pedestrians, sensors, and even lightposts. RGB pixels are also available conveniently in Simulink, facilitating camera-based ADAS function development. Furthermore, simulation runs can be automated with MATLAB scripts, which allows for performing tests with changed parameters and collecting results for processing, or exporting the data. Video can also be exported in different formates using a GUI visualization tool.\n\nSimple vehicle dynamics models are available in PreScan, which can be freely modified in Simulink. For more complex dynamics, PreScan allows for integration with other tools, such as CarSim and veDYNA.\n\n4.2 Vision to Speed Control\n\nSince the focus of this work is on learning systems in safety critical automotive applications, an example system is considered that controls the speed of the ego vehicle using camera images of the road. This study is delimited to longitudinal speed control, although a more comprehensive model was developed in Section 3.1.2.\n\nThe scenario consists of one leading vehicle fixed at some distance ahead of the ego vehicle. The task of the learning system is to detect the leading vehicle, and feed this information to a controller which then controls the gas and brake pedal positions. In such a setup, the output of the learning system can be readily compared to ground-truth for analysis.\n\nA deep neural network is used to detect the leading vehicle and provide bounding box information to be used for speed control. Since the distance to the leading vehicle is directly related to the bounding box size, a simple power-law function can be used to obtain a control signal, which then determines the gas and brake pedal positions.\n\nUsing such a setup where the learning system outputs intermediate bounding box information has some benefits:\n\n• This corresponds to a logical subproblem to the main speed control problem. If an end-to-end approach were used, the learning system would instead map pixel data to gas/brake pedal control. As discussed in Section 2.1, logical subsystems of end-to-end systems cannot be inspected, which allows a possibility for faults to be masked.\n\n• The ground truth is simple to determine, and depends only on images. In fact, the detector's performance can be assessed intuitively by viewing the resulting image sequence. For an end-to-end system, in contrast, the ground truth may depend on other factors such as the current speed and acceleration.\n\n• Since the scenario involves only one leading vehicle, the bounding box is sufficient information for a control strategy.\n\n• Many pretrained object detectors are available, allowing for the possibility of experimenting with existing state of the art networks.\n\nThe function of the learning system in this study is to identify the leading vehicle in camera images containing the road, environment, scenery and other traffic objects. For such a problem, object localization as well as classification are needed. One interesting approach is to use a region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN), which includes a region proposal network and an object classification network. A recent advancement in using this architecture is the Faster R-CNN [23, 24], where the classification network shares full-image convolutional features with the region proposal network, which enables nearly cost-free region proposals. The experiments presented in the following section employ a Faster R-CNN trained for localizing and classifying the leading vehicle.\n\n4.3 Experiments\n\nThe experimental setup considered consists of an empty stretch of road with one fixed vehicle located some distance ahead of the ego vehicle. A camera is placed behind the front windshield of the ego vehicle, and a Faster R-CNN system processes the images in order to control the speed. This simple experimental setup allows for testing only frontal collision avoidance. Extensions could be made in order to study more comprehensive scenarios, especially where the safety strategies are complex. However, this was not attempted in this experiment. More complex monitoring scenarios would help to test safety monitors, but contribute little to a safety investigation of the fundamental concerns with learning systems.\n\nThe strategy computed for the SMOF safety monitor in the longitudinal case (see Section 3.1.1) was to trigger a braking intervention when the warning region is in an approach state. This occurs as soon as when the distance to the leading vehicle becomes less than the safe distance. A key point is that the safety monitor can trigger interventions, rather than passively monitor, or only block actions, and technical specifications of interventions and region boundaries allow for guaranteeing collision avoidance if the specifications hold. The monitor calculates the safe distance dynamically based on the ego vehicle's current speed and the relative acceleration, using the approach presented in Section 3.2. Since in this simplified setup the leading vehicle is stationary, only the ego vehicle's deceleration curve is needed in the calculation.\n\nFigure 12 shows a block diagram of the control setup used for experiments. Camera images are used to control the speed of the ego vehicle, with a safety monitor installed to intervene when a warning state is reached. Ground truth information is used for safety monitoring, as this avoids introducing additional points of failure extraneous to the learning system under study.\n\nFigure 12: Control loop with safety monitoring\n\nThe goals for experiments are twofold: firstly to simulate the safety monitoring and vision-based control toolchains and demonstrate collision avoidance in cases of hazardous speed control; and secondly to discuss an example trustworthiness indicator for the learning system, which can help warn in advance before severe safety interventions are needed. This is related to the Safe Fail strategy mentioned in Section 2, in which the system does not attempt to offer an output in case of low confidence, or closeness to the decision boundary, and the operator makes the decision instead. However, in the speed control context, it is not possible to expect for the driver to immediately take over. The trustworthiness indication approach in this thesis allows for the driver to be warned regarding the learning system in a low confidence scenario.\n\n4.3.1 Design of Experiments\n\nThe Neural Network Toolbox in MATLAB 2017a offers an implementation of the Faster R-CNN deep learning system, including a class object and a function to train the detector. Although code from the Faster R-CNN authors is publicly available [23, 24], The implementation in the toolbox was opted for, due to ease of use and possibly quicker development time. Flexibility in regard to tweaking and tailoring algorithms for better performance is not a primary goal for this project.\n\nThe virtual world contains a straight stretch of road with some trees along the sides, and one vehicle fixed 300m ahead of the ego vehicle. The only variable that affects the camera images is the ego vehicle's position along the road. Therefore, by simply passing the camera along the road it is possible to capture images at any needed distance resolution.\n\nThis scenario avoids needing to perform image processing online. Image processing and driving simulation are computationally expensive tasks. At the time of conducting the work for this thesis, an adequate computational setup was not yet available, and the available GPU was not supported by MATLAB. This greatly limits the achievable frame rate as the detector is run on CPU instead. For 500x375 images, the detector computes at around 0.15 fps on the available machine, rather than 5 fps in the Faster R-CNN author's papers. For a closed loop setup, the detector would need to run in Simulink as an extrinsic function, since code generation for the Faster R-CNN object detector class is not supported in Simulink. The 0.15 fps would therefore not be improved. In addition, driving simulators are also computational expensive which further limits the speed. A closed-loop setup with such computational limitations would hinder the prototyping and evaluation of systems.\n\nOn the other hand, if a more complex scenario with moving objects were used, the camera images would depend on several variables that would be difficult to control, necessitating a closed-loop setup. As online image processing is not pursued, any of the previously mentioned virtual vehicle simulators could be used: IPG CarMaker, TESIS DYNA4, and TASS PreScan. CarMaker was selected primarily because it was made available before the other two. PreScan, along with a suitable computer setup for simulation was available only after completing the work for this thesis. The test vehicle chosen is the demo Tesla S model example provided in CarMaker, which uses an electrical powertrain, and a camera was added behind the front windshield.\n\nThe ego vehicle was passed along the road at low speed and the frontal camera's video stream was exported, and then processed to produce images at 0.1m resolution. These images are used for training and testing, as well as to precompute detections at 0.1m intervals along the road for access during simulations. The labeling process requires manually drawing the bounding box of the leading vehicle in each image. This process was automated with the help of the MATLAB Ground Truth Labeler app, which can interpolate between manually made labels at key frames.\n\nDue to computational limitations, small 128x228 images were used. Training of a Faster R-CNN is a four step process. In the first step, the region proposal network (RPN) is trained. In the second, a separate detection network is trained using the proposals from step 1 RPN. In the third step, the detector is used to initialize the RPN, but only the layers unique to the RPN are trained. Finally in the fourth step, the layers unique to the detector are trained. One problem that occurred frequently in my training attempts is that no positive or negative samples may be found in the fourth step, when the proposals from the third step are used. At far distances from the leading vehicle, less pixels are used to represent the vehicle, which presents a challenge in training. The training process could complete only if far distances are excluded.\n\nThe leading vehicle is 300m ahead along the road. Detectors for two different distance ranges were investigated:\n\n1. A detector was trained for the distance ranges 250-270m and 280-295m, using 351 training images.\n\n2. A detector was trained for the distance range 270-295m, using 251 training images.\n\n4.3.2 Safety Monitoring\n\nFor calculating the safety distance dynamically at run time, the deceleration curve of the ego vehicle, and the expected acceleration curve of the leading vehicle are needed. Modeling the behavior of the leading vehicle for collision avoidance scenarios is an interesting topic for dedicated research. Discussed in [22] is the concept of decision functions, in which dynamic models of the two vehicles and the expectation of their future actions are used as the basis for decisions. The scenario in this simple study uses a stationary leading vehicle, and the safety monitor is designed based on this operating condition. Also, the braking curve can vary with different road conditions. In this study, the effect of different road conditions is not investigated, and could be also a topic for further work.\n\nTo determine the braking curve of the Tesla demo vehicle model, braking tests were performed on the same road to be used in the experiments. Figure 13 shows the braking behavior for different starting speeds until the vehicle is stopped. It takes approximately 1.5 seconds to reach maximum deceleration, which continues until the vehicle is almost stopped. As shown in the figure, this initial phase is the same regardless of the starting speed. Inspecting the distance traveled in the final phase when going back to zero acceleration shows that it is only a few centimeters (2-4 cm). For safety monitoring, only the initial phase and the maximum deceleration phase will be used in safety distance calculation.\n\nFigure 13: Braking deceleration for CarMaker test vehicle\n\n4.3.3 Control System\n\nThe speed of the ego vehicle is controlled via the gas and brake pedal position signals in the CarMaker Simulink model. The Faster R-CNN system outputs bounding boxes (this locates the object within the image) and corresponding scores of detected objects classified as the leading vehicle. The area of the highest scoring bounding box is used as an indirect indicator of the leading vehicle's distance. This applies since the vehicles are configured to be in the same lane. The control law then used to obtain an intermediate signal is in the following form\n\nu = Aα\n\nwhere A is the bounding box area (width × height pixels) divided by the image area, and α is a tunable parameter that affect the cautiousness of the resulting control. The resulting signal u takes values from the 0-1 range. The gas and brake pedal positions can be derived from u according to:\n\nbrake =\n\n{\n\n2 (u− 0.5) u > 0.5\n\n0 u ≤ 0.5\n\ngas =\n\n{\n\n−2 (u− 0.5) u < 0.5\n\n0 u ≥ 0.5\n\nwhich results in braking with no gas when u is larger than 0.5, and gas with no brakes otherwise. Both gas and brake pedals are not engaged when u = 0.5.\n\nThis control strategy is implemented in Simulink as shown in Figure 14, with also a moving average included to smooth out u. This is helpful especially for malfunctioning detector behavior with momentary object appearance or disappearance. The window size used is 200 samples. The simulation is configured for variable step size in the CarMaker Simulink interface, but inspection shows that 200 samples correspond to about 0.2 seconds of simulation time.\n\nFigure 14: Simulink control system for brake and gas pedal\n\nSimulations were performed using ground truth bounding box information in order to calibrate the α parameter, and a suitable value found was 0.1. Figure 15 shows the resulting vehicle speed and the corresponding control signals. The vehicle was initialized at 100km/hour (ca. 27.8m/s). Figure 16 shows the distance trajectory, with the accident distance marked.\n\nFigure 15: Speed control for α = 0.1, and ground truth detections.\n\nFigure 16: Distance curve for α = 0.1, and ground truth detections.\n\n4.3.4 Evaluation Metrics\n\nTwo detectors for different distance ranges will be tested. The training difficulties were previously noted with regard to far distances, and training had to be restricted to closer distances for it to succeed. The first detector was trained for 250-270 and 280-295m, using 351 training images. Training did not yield good performance even within this training set, but this presents an interesting case for safety studies, as will be discussed. The second detector was trained for the easier 270-295m, using 251 training images. Much better performance could be achieved for this case within the training range, but this limited range helps to illustrate how a learning system can perform well for some data that was represented in the training, but cause hazardous behavior with unseen data.\n\nThe metric we will use for evaluating the performance of the learning system is the Intersection over Union (IoU) which is defined as IoU(A,B) =\n\narea(A ∩B) area(A ∪B)\n\nwhere A and B are the ground truth and detector bounding boxes. When multiple detections are produced by the detector, the highest scoring detection is used. The IoU does not distinguish between false positives and false negatives, but is a common metric for evaluating detectors and is sufficient given that false positives would trigger unwarranted braking.\n\nAnother measure that is of interest in this research is related to the similarity/dissimilarity of incoming camera images with the training images. Since the network is trained entirely using synthetic data from CarMaker, the influence of the training data can be controlled and accounted for. In addition, the random seed for the training process was fixed to insure reproducibility of the training results.\n\nAn example measure which utilizes SURF [25] features is used in these experiments. The SURF features of the highest scoring interest point in images are computed and used as descriptors. The disparity measure used in the experiments computes the Euclidean distance between the computed features of the runtime images to the nearest neighbor in the training set. SURF was chosen due to its speed advantages and scale invariance property. Other methods are not investigated in this study, but could be a topic for further research.\n\n4.3.5 First Detector\n\nThis detector was trained with 351 128x228 images for 250-270, and 280-295m distances. As previously mentioned, the less pixels used to represent the vehicle, the more difficult is the learning task. Attempts at training with the full 0-300m distance range have failed, and hence training was focused on closer distances where the leading vehicle is larger in the image. This detector was trained for 25 epochs.\n\nFigure 17 shows the IoU and disparity for the first detector, with the two distance ranges shaded. The measurements were filtered using a moving average of the same length as the moving average used for u, and 1 standard deviation curves are also plotted. The disparity is zero within the training intervals, as the incoming data was represented in the training set. On the other hand, distances away from the training intervals yielded high disparity, which decreases closer to the intervals. Ideally, the disparity measure should vary smoothly with distance, but this was seen not to be the case with using SURF features of a single interest point. Nonetheless, the metric helps to demonstrate that a disparity measure can be used to judge how well new data was represented in training. The detections were completely erroneous in the first trained interval, 250-270, as indicated by the IoU, while some detection capability is seen in the second trained interval 280-295.\n\nFigure 17: IoU and disparity mean and ± 1 standard deviation curves for the poor performing first detector. Notice low disparity close to and between training ranges.\n\nFigure 18 shows the trajectory of the ego vehicle along the road. An intervention was triggered, which successfully brought the vehicle to a halt before colliding with the leading vehicle.\n\nFigure 18: Distance trajectory along the road for the first detector, with braking intervention triggered\n\nThe speed control is shown in Figure 19, with the vehicle initialized at the start of the road with 0km/hour. A false positives period (vehicle detected as at close distance when it is actually farther away) caused braking starting at around 4 seconds. This is followed by a period where the detector is making some detections which are not accurate, as indicated by IoU in Figure 17. Afterwards, false negatives (vehicle detected as far away when it is actually near) caused an approach with high speed, which necessitates an intervention well before the trained intervals are encountered. In fact, the controller requested braking only towards the end of simulation when a good IoU is obtained.\n\nFigure 19: Speed control for the first detector. Dashed lines indicate overridden signal. False +ives indicate detecting a very near vehicle when it is in fact farther away, while false -ives indicate that the vehicle is detected as far away when it is in fact near.\n\n4.3.6 Second Detector\n\nIn light of the poor performance of the first detector, especially in its first trained distance range, a second attempt was made to train another detector with closer distances, making the learning task less difficult. The distance range was limited to 270-295m, and a detector was trained for 25 epochs with 251 training images.\n\nTraining indicated some success in learning within the trained distances. Two experiments are performed to illustrate both non-malfunctioning behavior where safety interventions are not required, and malfunctioning behavior that triggers the monitor interventions. In a low speed experiment, the needed safety distance does not exceed the trained range, which allows the controller an opportunity to operate within the learning system's trained distance range. Another experiment with higher approach speed was then performed, and a monitor intervention was necessary, since the learning system malfunctioned outside its trained distance range.\n\nLow speed experiment\n\nFor this experiment, the setup is initialized such that the learning system is allowed an opportunity to function within its trained distance range. Approaching at 70km/h would trigger an intervention at the start of the trained distance range, precluding the possibility of observing the controller's performance. The detector was seen to suffer from a false positives problem that brings the vehicle to a halt prematurely if initialized at the start of the road. To address these problems, the vehicle was initialized at 250m along the road with 35km/h.\n\nFigure 20 shows the IoU and disparity for the second detector. The measurements were filtered as before with detector 1 with the same moving average, and ±1 standard deviation curves are plotted. As indicated by the IoU, much better performance is attained within the learned distance range. The disparity is zero within the training intervals, as before, and is higher away from the trained data. The trend in disparity tends to be inversely related to the IoU performance measure.\n\nFigure 20: IoU and disparity mean and ± 1 standard deviation curves for the second detector low speed experiment.\n\nFigure 21 shows the trajectory of the ego vehicle along the road. An intervention was not required, as the controller successfully brought the vehicle to a halt before colliding with the obstacle.\n\nFigure 21: Distance trajectory along the road for the second detector low speed experiment, with braking intervention not triggered\n\nFigure 22 shows the speed control of the vehicle, initialized at the start of the road with 35km/hour. Light braking was requested initially in an untrained distance before 1.5s. Notice that this coincides with the IoU peak in Figure 20. Afterwards, braking was revoked and the gas pedal was increased briefly. Breaking is triggered again after the trained distance range is reached, stopping the vehicle before a collision.\n\nFigure 22: Speed control for the second detector low speed experiment.\n\nHigh speed experiment\n\nIn the high speed experiment with the second detector, the vehicle is instead initialized at 150m along the road, with 120km/h. At this speed, the needed safety distance is beyond the learning system's trained range. If the control fails to adequately brake prior to reaching the trained range, then a safety intervention would be needed.\n\nFigure 23 shows the filtered IoU and disparity curves in this experiment. The same trend is observed as previously in the other experiments, where the IoU performance tends to be inversely related to the run-time calculated disparity.\n\nFigure 23: IoU and disparity mean and ±1 standard deviation curves for the second detector high speed experiment.\n\nFigure 24 shows the trajectory of the ego vehicle along the road. As for the previous experiment with the first detector seen in Section 4.3.5, an intervention was triggered, which successfully stopped the vehicle and avoided the collision.\n\nFigure 24: Distance trajectory along the road for the second detector high speed experiment, with braking intervention triggered\n\nFigure 25 shows the speed control of the vehicle. Due to false positives (vehicle detected as at close distance when it is actually farther away), strong braking was activated before 1s. During this period zero IoU coupled with disparity peaks are observed in Figure 23. Shortly afterwards, false negatives (vehicle detected as far away when it is actually near) are obtained, which cause unsafe acceleration requiring an intervention. The controller continues to request acceleration until just before 4s where we have previously observed diminishing disparity. However, unlike for the low speed experiment, the controller requested braking too late and was already overridden by the safety monitor.\n\nFigure 25: Speed control for the second detector high speed experiment.\n\n4.4 Findings\n\nIn the experiments, the SMOF architecture has been used along with dynamic safety distances. The braking intervention was triggered at the right moments to prevent an accident, which resulted in the ego vehicle stopping only a few meters from collision. In addition, an example indicator for the learning system's trustworthiness has been demonstrated.\n\nThe disparity measure in the experiments tended to be inversely related to the learning system's performance, which is expected as performance should be better with data similar to the training set. This also suggests a potential for runtime trustworthiness indication using a disparity approach. Further research could investigate the development of better indicators and the desirable properties they should possess. For example, the disparity indicator used the features of only the highest scoring SURF interest point. In theory, SURF interest points are scale invariant and should not greatly fluctuate as the ego vehicle approaches the other vehicle. However, some fluctuations were observed in the experiments. Brief inspections showed that, for some distances, the highest scoring interest point can change abruptly for minor variation in scale. It could help to investigate combining several interest points, but this would increase the computational demand. Also, SURF operates on gray-scale images. This overlooks possibly essential color information that can affect the performance of the learning system. Other approaches can be tested that incorporate spatial as well as color features of images.\n\nof images.\n\nThe motivation behind the disparity measure is to obtain a reliable trustworthiness metric that can be computed at run time for incoming data in order to indicate the performance of the learning system. The best ways to utilize this trustworthiness indication could also be a topic for further research. Using it within a safety monitor would yield a more complex monitor, and present challenges with verification or certification. However, such trustworthiness metric can be of help in alerting the driver before a safety monitor intervention is required. Safety interventions can be unpleasant for the driver, as is the case with the full force braking used in the experiments.\n\n5 Discussion\n\nThis section discusses and summarizes the thesis, and points to possible directions for further work.\n\nThe safety concerns with learning systems were discussed in Section 2. Several concerns emerge from the loss functions and the training data used for developing learning systems. When using quantities such as average prediction error, loss functions may not account for the human cost that is relevant for safety. The training samples may not correctly reflect the scenario that was aimed for, and may inadequately represent rare cases that are highly relevant for safety. Learning systems were discussed for autonomous driving, with particular focus on end-to-end systems. The end-to-end paradigm, discussed in Section 2.1 is an extremely capable approach where complex learning problems are solved implicitly by the systems, without the need to identify and address the logical subproblems. From a safety viewpoint, this compounds the challenges associated with obtaining adequate training data, due to possible fault masking effects. Following a discussion of some relevant sections of the ISO 26262, a promising approach was indicated for meeting safety goals, which involve introducing separate architectural elements that are more amenable to meeting stringent safety requirements, while the learning systems themselves can be exempt from needing to comply with the standard. It was discussed also that verifying properties of learning systems at the technical/mathematical level may not be of help in autonomous driving applications, as that would involve specifying properties of input pixel values and output quantities. Instead, a safety monitoring approach was motivated.\n\nSafety monitoring was discussed in Section 2.3. Formal methods and model checking are useful tools in the design of safety monitors. However, important to consider is the state space explosion problem that can limit the scalability of model checkers. The SMOF safety monitoring approach was found particularly interesting, due to the possibility for monitors that implement interventions, rather than only inhibitions, and the possibility of automatically generating safety strategies. This approach has been applied to a longitudinal collision avoidance scenario, and also a scenario targeting combined longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance. Technical implementation aspects of interventions were also discussed, and an approach was presented for calculating region boundaries using time-varying acceleration models.\n\nA case study was presented in Section 4, involving the use of a learning system to control the vehicle's speed using camera pixel data. The use of simulations for supporting this study was discussed, with important considerations being functionalities for off-line data export, closed loop control, and an adequate virtual world accuracy. Three simulation tools were tried: IPG CarMaker, TESIS DY-NAware, and TASS PreScan. CarMaker was not found to support a vision-based closed loop control setup, but was nonetheless used due to its earlier availability, and challenges with computational resources and time that anyway preclude online closed loop control. A simple scenario was pursued, for which offline processing helps in avoiding the online processing needed in a closed loop setup. Experiments were built within a simulation environment for frontal collision avoidance, including safety monitoring and control toolchains. The SMOF architecture was used, and interventions were triggered following dangerous malfunctioning behavior in the learning system. Finally, also an indicator was presented for the trustworthiness of the learning system during operation.\n\nFurther work could investigate simulations with more complex safety monitoring scenarios, beyond the frontal collision avoidance tested in this thesis. In implementing safety interventions with the approach presented in this thesis, an essential information is the expected future trajectory of the object. This was not studied, and the object was simply assumed to be stationary in the experiments.\n\nThis topic can be investigated in a further work. If the solution is probabilistic, that would present an interesting concern with regard to determinism in safety monitoring. Finally, a simple example was offered in this thesis to illustrate trustworthiness indication, and little effort was aimed at developing a good performing metric. This topic could be further investigated, including the application of such indicator within safety systems. It is important in particular that computation is feasible online.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] \"Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems,\" Standard SAE J3016, Society of Automotive Engineers, 2016.\n\n[2] P.

Similarity Matching in Computer Vision and Multimedia.\n\nA Safety Distance for Time-Varying Acceleration\n\nConsider that two objects are moving towards each other with relative acceleration a(t) > 0, given an initial relative speed v0, which reaches 0 at the time of collision. The minimal initial separation x0 that avoids a trajectory reaching 0 distance needs to be found.\n\nRelative acceleration is the sum of the ego vehicle's and the object's accelerations towards each other, a(t) = as(t) + ai(t). Assume a conservative estimate of the object's predicted worst-case acceleration âi(t) during the intervention time window, and a conservative estimate of the ego vehicle's ability to counteract the acceleration âs. Let the worst case evolution of relative acceleration be â(t) = âs(t) + âi(t). The task is to obtain the initial separation x0 that avoids a trajectory reaching 0 distance.\n\nThe equivalent force causing relative acceleration â(t) can be expressed as F = m1â(t) +m2â(t)\n\n= (m1 +m2) dv(t)\n\ndt\n\n.\n\nWork done by this force resulting in a small movement dx is given by dw = Fdx\n\n= (m1 +m2) dv\n\ndt dx\n\n= (m1 +m2) dx\n\ndt dv = (m1 +m2)vdv\n\nThe amount of work done to cause a loss of the initial speed v0 can be found using\n\nW =\n\n∫ 0\n\nv0\n\n(m1 +m2)vdv\n\n= −1\n\n(m1 +m2)v2\n\n2 0\n\nwith the negative indicating work done in the opposite direction to the direction of increasing velocity.\n\nIf this amount of work is done by F , then the relative speed between the objects goes to zero when they collide. We need ∫ 0\n\nx0\n\nFdx = −1\n\n(m1 +m2)v2\n\n2 0∫ 0\n\nx0\n\n(m1 +m2)a(t)dx = − (m1 +m2)v\n\n1 2\n\n2 0\n\n∴\n\n∫ 0\n\nx0\n\nâ(t)dx = −1 2\n\nv20\n\nThis gives a relation between initial velocity and required separation under time-varying acceleration.\n\n52\n\n53\n\nTRITA MMK 2017: 149 MES 015\n\nwww.kth.se",

Cloud computing is a term that refers to a<a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/network\"> network</a> of<a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/remote\"> remote </a>servers<a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/host#host\"> hosted</a> on the internet to store, manage and process data, rather than on a local server or a personal computer. Vendor lock-in is an outcome that causes companies to pay a significant cost to move between cloud providers. The effects that cause vendor lock-in that will be described are portability, interoperability and federation are called the lock-in effects. The goal of the research is to help Scania IT understand the vendor lock-in and the vulnerabilities they can face in the transition to the cloud as well as to clarify the concern that they may have against falling in vendor lock-in. The main purpose of the research is to present the various lock-in effects that are related to the transition from one cloud provider to another and the vulnerabilities that cause companies to fall in vendor lock-in. The thesis presents the reasons that motivates why Scania IT would consider using the cloud and the concerns that they may have against usage of a cloud computing platform. The results will be based on a case study of a similar company that has moved to a cloud provider and specifically Microsoft Azure and an interview of Microsoft Azure point of view with the risk of vendor lock-in. Finally, a process of interviews with different people from Scania IT to extract the current bottleneck in the development process that caused the company to think of a cloud computing platform. The results show that companies should consider many risks and factors while moving to the cloud, as vendor lock-in, cloud maturity index and their IT strategies. As a result, the thesis gives recommendations of the steps needed to minimize the risks of the cloud while maintaining the positivity of the cloud. </p><h4><p>Keywords: Cloud computing, vendor lock-in, lock-in effects, portability, interoperability, federation, Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, Infrastructure as a Service. </p></h4><h2><p>Sammanfattning </p></h2><p>Uppsatsen presenterar en studie om de sårbarheter som ett företag som Scania IT har mot inlåsning i övergången till molntjänster. Molntjänster är en term som hänvisar till ett nätverk av servrar som finns på internet för att lagra, hantera och processa data, istället för på en lokal server eller en persondator. Inlåsning är ett resultat i vilket orsakar att företagen behöver betala en betydande kostnad för att flytta mellan molnleverantörer. De effekter som orsakar inlåsning vilket kommer att beskrivas är portabilitet, interoperabilitet och federation, dessa kallas inlåsningseffekter. Målet med forskningen är att hjälpa Scania IT att förstå inlåsning och sårbarheter som de kan möta i övergången till molnet. Dessutom är målet att klarlägga riskerna som de kan ha mot att falla i inlåsning. Det huvudsakliga syftet med forskningen är att presentera de olika inlåsningseffekter som är relaterade till övergången från en molnleverantör till en annan samt de sårbarheter som orsakar företagen att falla i inlåsning. Uppsatsen presenterar skäl som motiverar varför Scania IT ska överväga att använda molnet samt den oro som de kan ha mot användning av en molnleverantör. Resultaten kommer att baseras på en fallstudie av ett liknande företag som har flyttat till en molnleverantör och specifikt Microsoft Azure samt en intervju av Microsoft Azure synvinkel med risken för inlåsning. Slutligen, en rad av intervjuer med olika personer från Scania IT för att extrahera den nuvarande flaskhalsen i utvecklingsprocessen som orsakade företaget att tänka på molntjänster. Resultaten visar att företagen bör överväga många risker och faktorer när de flyttar till molnet, som exempelvis inlåsning, cloud maturity index och deras IT-strategier. Som ett resultat ger examensarbetet nödvändiga rekommendationer för att minimera riskerna för molnet samtidigt som positivitet av molnet. </p><p>Nykelord: Cloud computing, vendor lock-in, lock-in effects, portability, interoperability, federation, Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, Infrastructure as a Service. </p><h2><p>Acknowledgements </p></h2><p>This Master thesis is the last part of my degree program in Information and Communication Technology at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.

Since that time, Scania has built and delivered more than 1,400,000 trucks and buses for heavy transport work [1]. Scania IT is a part of Scania CV AB, which is responsible for the development of the applications and handling infrastructure of Scania CV AB. Scania IT are currently having all their work and infrastructure on-premises. So currently Scania IT is looking for a better economical and flexible solution, with the aim to decrease time to market. Therefore Scania IT is considering implementing a cloud computing platform, since they assume it will lead to reaching globally faster and will contribute to continuous delivery, which is an important goal to Scania IT that they are always striving to achieve with optimization. Many concerns are listed within Scania IT in the transition to the cloud such as security issues, lack of control and reliability. However the main concern that they want to analyze is vendor lock-in and the vulnerabilities that cause the companies to fall in vendor lock-in. Vendor lock-in is the outcome that makes a customer dependent on a specific <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vendor_(supply_chain)\">vendor</a> for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/product_(business)\">products</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/service_(economics)\">services</a> unable to use another vendor without substantial <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/switching_barriers\">switching costs</a>. Therefore the thesis will present a study about this main concern to Scania IT in moving to a cloud computing platform. </p><p>1.1 Problem statement </p><p>Scania IT is seeking for improvement for the rate of delivering services and applications with providing a faster delivery rate, which contributes to continuous delivery that tries to deliver improvements to an application as often as possible while maintaining quality. Moreover, Scania IT wants to investigate deeply the many unresolved and open problems related to the mature technologies of cloud computing. One of these technologies is vendor lock-in, which is caused by the lock-in effects that will be described in this thesis such as portability, which is the ability to move applications, data, and tools from one cloud vendor to another in a company that wants to use a cloud provider such as Scania IT. Another effect is the interoperability, which is the ability for different clouds to communicate with each other. Portability and interoperability effects play a big role in causing vendor lock-in, which causes companies to pay a significant cost to move between cloud providers. </p><p>Moreover, Scania CV AB is a large international company where several countries are involved to many applications that are found in Södertalje (The main office); therefore a goal they are always striving to achieve is global accessibility from around the world. </p><h4><p>1.2 Related work and contribution </p><p>To accomplish the transition to the cloud, there are many factors that need to be taken into account as shown in figure 1-1 below [2]. </p></h4><p>Figure 1-1 Cloud computing pros and cons and some of the issues directed in the thesis [2] </p><p>General studies in the field of deployment of cloud computing bring up some ongoing discussions. Figure 1-1 above shows that there are four main cons to cloud computing which are security, lock-in, lack of control and reliability [2]. </p><p>Since cloud computing is a big technological aim to provide flexibility and economic improvement to companies and customers. For companies to use cloud computing, they need to discuss and research these benefits versus the risks of cloud computing. Therefore a literature study has been conducted to provide an empirical investigation of cloud computing using multiple sources of evidence and in-depth analysis of several previous studies. </p><p>Greenwood et al [3] showed that cloud computing can be significantly cheaper alternative to purchasing and maintaining system infrastructure in-house. Despite these advantages, he showed that there are some important socio-technical issues that need to be considered before organizations would move their IT systems to the cloud [3]. Petcu et al [4] have proposed a layered set of APIs that are offering a supplementary degree of freedom, from programming languages and style. Kostoska et al [5] has proposed a new cloud portability service platform and gave an overview of the current trends in the area of cloud service portability. Kostoska discussed that there are no standard solutions for cloud service portability, mainly due to a huge number of various cloud providers on the market. However, he named two approaches that are known in technology area to cope with emerging markets and offer. The first approach is using the most successful provider, which will \"kill\" the other in the concurrent market environment, and the other to establish a highly recognized standard accepted by all market players [5]. The second approach is using Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA), which represents a first step towards building a standard for portable deployment and the migration of existing applications onto a cloud [5]. Guillen et al [6] proposed a framework which aims to favour cloud agnostic software development, which helps companies continue building their applications without having to modify their technology, and also without having to choose a single immovable cloud provider. Moreover, Ranabahu et al [7] indicated that using Domain Specific Languages (DSL) shows a promise in developing portable applications for the cloud and related platforms. They have done some tests and the results shown were very promising for a portable cloud platform. </p><p>It can be concluded so far, almost all researches for cloud computing are pointed towards solutions of portability and ways to overcome vendor lock-in. However not much has been discussed about the vulnerabilities that make companies like Scania IT fall into vendor lock-in. Also, the reason why it is a concern to companies considering the usage of cloud computing. Therefore, the contribution that thesis aims to address is the existing gaps in the deployment of a cloud computing and specifically Microsoft Azure in an International huge company like Scania IT and fills the research gap, which is the lack of studies for the reasons and vulnerabilities that companies face in the deployment of a cloud provider. </p><p>Furthermore, the thesis represents some ideas on how to resolve some problems faced when deploying a cloud computing platform. It is believed that the thesis research questions will be filled by the conclusions made on this project. Therefore, some research questions will be presented in order to show what would be the direction of study during different steps of this project and eventually by answering these questions the final conclusion will be made. </p><p>The main problem area is related to the title of the thesis: </p><p><i>Despite the fact that Cloud Computing is a popular evolved computing terminology based on the consumption of computing resource and proven to be cost efficient and more flexible with a reduce in the amount of physical infrastructure that a company have to keep and maintain. However some downsides are security and vendor lock-in. So why such a technology has not been applied or discussed in huge companies like Scania CV AB? </i></p><p><i>Since the previous statement is not easy to resolve, it should be cleaved: </i></p><p><b><i>(1)</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i> Why is the cloud a raised issue in Scania IT? </i></b></p><p><b><i>(2)</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i> Why is Scania IT vulnerable to vendor lock-in in the transition to a cloud computing platform? </i></b></p><p><b><i>(3)</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i> Why is vendor lock-in a concern to Scania IT when using a cloud computing platform? </i></b></p><p>The above order was based on a sequence that would be easy to follow. The work would start by answering the research question (1) that would lead companies to think of the positive side of the cloud. However the drawbacks of the cloud such as vendor lock-in raised questions (2) and (3) to be interesting to examine as most companies do not take into consideration the movement out of the cloud. After identifying the missing gap and the research questions, it could be derived the goal and purpose of the study in the following sub-sections. </p><p>1.3 Goals </p><p>The goal of the study is to emphasize the reason why Scania IT needs to consider the deployment of a cloud computing platform and to help Scania IT understand the vendor lock-in and the associated vulnerabilities they can face in the transition to the cloud as well as to clarify the concern they may have against falling into vendor lock-in and show what can be done to decrease the risks of cloud computing. </p><p> 1.3.1 Benefits and Sustainability </p><p>The audience of this document are companies that want to use a cloud computing platform and want to understand more the risks rather than the benefits of cloud computing. They could use the solution proposed in the thesis to minimize the risks of vendor lock-in and benefit from the steps and ways to minimize the risks of cloud computing. </p><p>Sustainability aspects were also taken into account, which is reusing the work that had already been analyzed in Scania and build on it what was missing to achieve a useful thesis that can help the companies that are thinking of using a cloud computing platform. Moreover, the work submitted and analyzed can be reused by other companies to minimize the risks of cloud computing and improve companies maturity rate within cloud computing, which contributes to sustainability. </p><p>1.4 Delimitations </p><p>The name of the company in the case study that has been done by interviewing the person who was involved in this transition will be stayed anonymous, due to ethical reasons and request of the owner of the information in the case study. </p><p>1.5 Outline of the thesis </p><p>Chapter 2 presents the methodology used in performing the work. Also, gives the reader a more insight of which methods are used in this research and why they are preferable methods. The chapter gives more details of how data is collected and how the analysis of Vendor lock-in vulnerabilities is performed. </p><p>Chapter 3 is the start of the author contribution and presents for the reader a history and a wide introduction to cloud computing. Also, gives an introduction on the different service and deployment models. Finally, it gives an idea about two main cloud providers. </p><p>Chapter 4 presents the investigations that are performed in the company to understand the development process and bottlenecks that Scania IT is currently facing and give reasons why Scania IT should consider the cloud. </p><p>Chapter 5 presents the lock-in effects that cause vendor lock-in and the different types of vendor lock-in. </p><p>Chapter 6 presents the evaluations of investigations that were carried out to figure out if Scania IT is vulnerable to vendor lock-in. </p><p>Chapter 7 presents the conclusion with the answer to the research questions and the future work that can be done by other researchers and Scania IT. </p><h2><p>2. Method </p></h2><h4><p>This chapter represents the methodology and the framework of the research, data collection, selection, application and evaluation of the data collection method. The work with this thesis was divided into several stages that contributed to the final conclusion. </p></h4><h4><p>2.1 Methodology </p></h4><p><b> </b></p><p>To perform this thesis work, given the explorative nature of the research objectives, a qualitative research method was chosen instead of quantitative method. The quantitative research method uses experiments and large data sets to reach a conclusion, while the qualitative research method uses investigations in an interpretative manner to create theories [8]. The thesis applies the qualitative method because it helps to understand the vulnerabilities that companies such as Scania IT can fall into and the lock-in effects that cause the difficulty of moving between different cloud providers. Qualitative research method answers to questions, such as why, how and what [8]. </p><p>Research approaches are needed to draw conclusion and to be clear whether these conclusions are true or false. There are several methods that can be used, such as inductive, deductive or abductive approach, which includes both the latter named methods. Inductive approach is when the research resonate theories based on experiences and opinions. While, deductive approach resonate theories to verify or falsify hypotheses. Inductive approach is often used when data is collected with qualitative methods [8]. </p><p>The thesis will apply inductive approach since there is no clear theory to verify or falsify hypotheses, which applies in a deductive approach. However, a deep analysis is needed to gain an understanding of the different cloud computing techniques and their effect on the company specially the lock-in effects. Also, since the outcome is based on interviews of different employees in the development process and getting an idea of how they work today when compared to working with a cloud computing platform as Microsoft Azure. </p><p>The work contribution involved several stages: </p><p><b>1.</b><b> </b><b> Literature Study </b></p><p><b>2.</b><b> </b><b>Interviews internal and external </b></p><p><b>3.</b><b> </b><b>Analysis of Scania intranet system </b></p><p><b>4.</b><b> </b><b>Case Study </b></p><p>Starting with a literature study, this is needed to analyze the present situation of the company and the current work done in this area. This analysis was performed by studying secondary data such as reports, conference presentations, online information, user guides, press releases, white papers and articles. </p><p>The second step was data collection for carrying out the study, which was by interviews. The interviews of people in the current development process of Scania IT was performed to understand the bottleneck in the process and motivate for reasons for the need of the cloud. The interviews were done by carrying out unstructured or semi-structured data collection techniques i.e. individual depth interviews and group discussions in this case. This field research consisted of interviewing developers, testers and software oriented architecture experts. The exact interviewees for this project were mainly addressed to three teams in one section of Scania IT. The process started by interviewing maintenance managers of each department in one section of the company. Then the process proceeded by interviewing a system developer and tester in that specific section. Finally, the process of interview was directed to a higher rank, which is Change Management department. Interviewing different people was done to understand the current process, then an analysis of Scania's intranet system was needed to provide a wider picture of the inner work of Scania and the structure of how they work. Then an external interview was performed with the solution lead principle for Microsoft Azure to understand their offerings for companies and their perspective on vendor lock-in. </p><p>Furthermore, a case study of a company that has had the experience about transition to the cloud provider and specifically Microsoft Azure. Case studies involved reading previous experience of the adoption of the cloud and gathering information that will help make the analysis to Scania IT and solve the worries that can be found. This case study has been deducted through a semi-structured interview to one of the employees that was in charge of this transition and the questions were directed to how this company dealt with vendor lock-in. Finally, the idea of the cloud maturity index, showing how mature Scania IT is towards cloud computing led to the proposal of an IT strategy to define applications in Scania IT moving to a cloud hence lead to a higher rank of cloud maturity. </p><p>2.2 Framework of the study </p><p>In order to make the work structured in a way that would be comprehensive and easy to follow. A framework was created by the author with the steps need to answer the research questions. This particular order of steps found in figure 2-1 was the order that was used to answer the research questions, which are described below in details. </p><p><b>Problem: </b>This is the first step in the thesis, where the problem was concluded from the current situation of Scania IT and the reasons gathered behind the study of cloud computing. </p><p><b>Related Work: </b>Following the problem, the work started by reading other researchers work and extracting the related work and figuring out the thesis gap. From that literature study, the research questions were introduced. <b> </b></p><p><b>Cloud Computing Theory: </b>Then following that a deep detailed analysis of the cloud computing theory was needed to give the reader a broad understanding of cloud computing, which will be needed to understand the rest of the work. </p><p><b>Interviews: </b>After representing the data about cloud theory, 14 interviews from within Scania IT have been performed to understand their <b>current development process</b> and discuss the work and tools that are needed in each process. From these interviews, it was concluded as well the bottlenecks that Scania IT are currently facing. Ethics was taken into account in this interview research. That being said, in all interviews that were conducted it was asked to the interviewees whether it was allowed to use and reference the data given in the interview and if it was allowed to use their name and position in the thesis if needed. </p><p><b>Microsoft Azure Interview: </b>That included an interview for a Principal Solutions Lead - Azure in Microsoft. That was to better understand their services and their view on vendor lock-in as leading cloud providers in both IaaS and PaaS service models. </p><p><b>Case Study Company X:</b> That was an important step to gather the company's opinion on vendor lock-in, where the author interviewed the person responsible about the movement to the cloud in company X. This was used to evaluate if Scania IT can follow the same pattern and avoid vendor lock-in. </p><p><b>Cloud Maturity Index: </b>This analysis step was to evaluate what was Scania IT current situation with cloud maturity and how to move to a higher stage. Therefore a <b>Hybrid IT</b> strategy was created as a flowchart guideline for companies to follow in order to achieve a high maturity stage. </p><h4><p>Figure 2-1 The framework that was used in the thesis work </p><p>The green arrows illustrate that all the work performed results to the answer the research questions.</p></h4><p><b> </b></p><h4><p>The red arrows illustrate the order of the steps taken to answer the research question starting with problem, all the way to the cloud maturity index analysis. </p></h4><h2><p>3. Cloud Computing Theory </p></h2><h4><p>This chapter presents a background theory on cloud computing, cloud service models, cloud deployment models and top three cloud providers. Moreover, there will be a clarification about the difference between vendor lock-in and lock-in effects. </p></h4><p>3.1 What is Cloud Computing? </p><p>Cloud computing is a new terminology that was added to the IT industry in early 2007 [9]. Cloud Computing is the practice of<a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/use\"> using</a> a<a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/network\"> network</a> of<a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/remote\"> remote</a> servers<a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/host#host\"> hosted</a> on the<a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/internet\"> Internet</a> to<a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/store\"> store</a>, <a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/manage\">manage</a>, and<a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/process#process\"> process </a>data, rather than a<a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/local\"> local</a> server or a<a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/personal-computer\"> personal computer</a> [12]. </p><p>The national Institute of Standards &amp; Technology has defined Cloud Computing as follows [10]: <i>\"Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.</i>\" </p><h4><p> </p><p>These cloud service and deployment models will be discussed in the next section. However the five essential characteristics will be listed below and described [10]. </p></h4><p><b>1.</b><b> </b><b>On-demand self-service:</b><i> </i>A consumer can use computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage without requiring human interaction with each service provider. </p><p><b>2.</b><b> </b><b>Broad network access:</b> Computing capabilities are available over the network and can be accessed by any device (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).<b> </b></p><p><b>3.</b><b> </b><b>Resource pooling:</b><i> </i>Computing resources that are owned by the cloud provider are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth.<b> </b></p><p><b>4.</b><b> </b><b>Rapid elasticity:</b><i> </i>Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.<b> </b></p><p><b>5.</b><b> </b><b>Measured service:</b> Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported so providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.<b> </b></p><p>3.2 Cloud Service Models </p><p>There are three common service models that are represented in relation to cloud computing, which are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). These models will be represented in details below. </p><p> Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) </p><p>Infrastructure as a Service is a service offering a focus towards those who have knowledge of how to configure the software portion of the technology stack, but do not want to manage the hardware [14]. Infrastructure is the base of the stack and provides all the raw computing resources. </p><p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) </p><p>Platform as a Service is a service aimed to developers that help them develop and test applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. Developers do not want to have to worry about provisioning the servers, storage and backup associated with developing and launching an application [15]. The platform services provide users with software, virtual machines (VMs) and usually handle all aspects of system administration for the user. On the other hand, the customers would need only to handle the applications and data as illustrated in figure 3-1. </p><p>Software as a Service (SaaS) </p><p>Another type of cloud computing model is Software as a Service, which is a service that means that the cloud computing provider is in charge of applications, data, operating system, storage, service and the rest as shown in the figure 3-1 [2]. The consumer buys the services without worrying about the customization or maintenance of the hardware. They need to just stay connected to the cloud provider. </p><p>Figure 3-1 Different models and what is managed by the company versus what is managed by the cloud provider </p><p>Figure 3-1 illustrates the separation of responsibilities for on-premises versus three service models, IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, where it presents what is manageable by the cloud provider versus what is managed by the customer. So, <i>Other manages</i> illustrates the cloud providers as Microsoft Azure or Amazon. While <i>You Manage, </i>illustrates the customer as Scania IT. </p><p>3.3 Cloud Deployment Models </p><p>There are five common deployment models that are represented in relation to cloud computing, which are public cloud, private cloud, private virtual cloud, community cloud and hybrid cloud. </p><p>Public Cloud </p><p>A public cloud is available to the public or a large industry group and is owned by the organization selling cloud services [16]. Public cloud resources are normally provisioned on demand or on dynamic basis over the internet [16]. In the public cloud, the servers are the same for all companies in the cloud but with different structures, where different companies can share the servers. This can be shown in figure 3-2. The limitation of the public cloud is the security concerns that the cloud servers are shared by many companies. This can be motivated since many cloud servers are in the </p><p>same cloud infrastructure and therefore there is a lot of resources that are shared among the different companies that can be found in the cloud. </p><p>Private Cloud </p><p>A private cloud provides an easy, flexible and effective way to request, use and deploy IT resources, applications and virtual machines (VMs) on hardware that is dedicated to a single organization [11]. It can exist on premises or off premises [16]. The private cloud is an emulation of the public cloud, typically on a private network, and exists to support the goals of the organization, rather than to generically support resources for multiple organizations [16]. Private cloud customers have their own servers and ports. This is illustrated in figure 3-2. The limitation of the private cloud is that it can be more expensive than a public cloud. Since each cloud infrastructure is particularly to one cloud consumer and therefore nothing is shared with other consumers making it more expensive when compared to the public cloud. </p><p>Virtual private cloud </p><p>An alternative solution to addressing the limitations of both public and private clouds is called Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). VPC is where the cloud is present in a cloud provider data center such as Amazon, Azure data center, where each server has its own network of companies' information. It </p><p>uses a multi-tenant shared services model as the public cloud but the partitions a single instance of resources are for an individual customer. VPC customers \"share\" the core cloud platform but the virtual machines they use are dedicated for their own private use, which makes it more isolated than the public cloud and the user has complete control over their virtual networking environment, including selection of their own IP address range, creation of subnets. This also allows customers to design their own security firewalls when compared to the public cloud limitation. However the limitation in VPC is the use multi-tenant, while many customers prefer the use of single-tenant. Since there is a fear of sharing other customers the core cloud platform. </p><p>Community Cloud </p><p>A Community cloud is shared by several organizations to support a specific community, which is only accessible for these organizations [10]. The infrastructure can be operated and owned by the cloud provider or the organization. These communities would most probably share privacy and performance requirements. The limitation that can be found is the sharing of the cloud platform as the public and virtual private cloud. If there is no trust between the organizations using the cloud, there can be a risk of information leakage. Also, to provide resources and a cloud computing infrastructure to the community requires a huge amount of investment, which can limit the resources to the organization making them less wanting to share the cloud and use the community cloud. </p><p>Hybrid Cloud </p><p>A Hybrid cloud is the combination of two different methods of resource pooling; it could be two cloud deployment models like public with community [10]. This combination of two or more cloud providers is remained as a unique entity that is bound together by standardized technology that allows data and applications portability [16]. Hybrid cloud is one of the best solutions, where it includes many deployment models with the benefits and limitations of each. </p><p>While a Hybrid IT is the result of combining internal and external services, usually from a combination of internal and public clouds, in support of a business outcome [33]. The comparison can be better illustrated in figure 3-2. Hybrid IT includes traditional IT with all the cloud deployment models (Hybrid cloud) shown below. </p><h4><p>Figure 3-2 Different delivery models and illustrates the Hybrid cloud and Hybrid IT [31] </p></h4><p>3.4 Cloud Providers </p><p>Cloud providers are a company that provides cloud computing services and solutions to customers, which can be individuals or businesses. The cloud provider delivers solutions that are pay-as-you-go, meaning that the customers need only to pay while using such services. These solutions are the ones named in the previous chapter, which are IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. The two providers that are discussed are Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are top leading providers in different cloud models. Amazon is leading in IaaS services and Microsoft Azure has become a leader since 2014 in both IaaS and PaaS services [25; 26]. This information was published by Gartner [25; 26] and the charts can be found in appendix A. </p><p>Microsoft Azure </p><p>Microsoft Azure is the cloud provider that Scania IT wants to adopt. Microsoft Azure is Microsoft's cloud platform [34], which is a growing collection of integrated service such as compute, storage, data, networking, and applications that help the customer move faster, do more, and save money [34]. Azure is an industry leader for both IaaS and PaaS services as ranked by Gartner [25; 26; 34]. IaaS and PaaS combined together give services that let customers build, deploy, and manage applications any way you like for unmatched productivity [34]. </p><p>Amazon Web services (AWS) </p><p>Amazon web services were founded by Bezo in 1994 as an online book store [27] and in year 2002, it was officially one of the top 500 companies in US [27]. Amazon is the leading provider in IaaS services as ranked by Gartner [25; 26]. They have several PaaS services that have been introduced in 2011 such as \"elastic beanstalk\" [28], which allow users to create application and push them into a defined set of AWS services. </p><h2><p>4. Current development process and bottleneck in Scania IT </p></h2><p>This chapter is done by investigating the current development process that Scania IT is currently going through all the way to production. Then, concludes with the bottlenecks that have made Scania IT think about the adoption of the cloud platform. The aim of this chapter was to understand the development process and the vulnerabilities that Scania IT is currently facing and whether it can be solved by using the cloud. </p><p>4.1 Current development process </p><p>A study of the current development process of Scania IT was needed to evaluate the process that Scania IT is currently using and the tools they use for their applications. The current development process was gathered by interviewing a group of people working in Scania IT and in the process of change management process which is name of the process that Scania IT is working with to deliver products. </p><p>The development process goes through several procedures. The development process starts by having a Change Request (CR), meaning that a request to change for an application served to a customer, which is Scania. The CR can be a change in an application or an upgrade of Scania's database. Then after figuring out the start of the process, the work started by interviewing three different maintenance managers (MM), which are responsible for handling the CR. MM are also in charge of the control of installation, repair and upkeep of employers' property, including machines and mechanical systems. They may also take on more administrative tasks, depending on the specifics of their job. Then moving to a higher rank that is change management department. MM currently uses a system called \"Jira\", which is an issue tracking product on Scania that is used for Trouble Reports (TRs) and Change Requests (CRs) made during software development, maintenances and projects alike. MM handles CRs within the team, which means that the MM has discussed with the developers and testers who will be responsible about that specific change. </p><p>A Request for Change (RFC) is issued by the MM on a system called \"Remedy\", which is handled by the Change management (CM), responsible. Therefore an interview to the person responsible was conducted to understand more about their system and their process. CM is in charge of minimizing the number, and impact, of incidents caused by planned changes to the Scania IT service production environment. Also, to ensure that all IT services are carefully prepared for a safe and secure operation. When the CM has agreed on the change, the application needed to be changed is done and moves to the stage of production. This is shown in details in figure 4-1 below. The steps can be summarized with respect to the figure: </p><p>1. Scania CV AB, the customer issues a change request (CR) to Maintenance Managers (MM). </p><p>2. After MM register in\"Jira\" system, they issue a Request for Change (RFC) through a system called \"Remedy\" to the Change Management team (CM). </p><p>3. The CM looks at the editing and does the necessary things as written in the figure 4-1. After approval about the quality, risk analysis and other things, they send the CR to production to take care of it. </p><h4><p>Figure 4-1 Development process of Scania IT </p></h4><p>In between the MM and the CM, DevOps can be found as shown in the figure 4-2. Two DevOps in the Scania IT were interviewed to understand their role in the process. DevOps comes from the combinations of the initials of <b>Dev</b>elopers and <b>Op</b>eration<b>s. </b>They are in charge of decreasing the gap between developers and operations by synchronizing the methods and tools used between both. As seen in figure No. There was a further interview conducted to the creator of this process and the one responsible about continuous updates to the process. He talked about his continuous effort along </p><h4><p>with his team to optimize the change management process and ease the process to help Scania IT workers to delivery faster with the aim of continuous delivery. </p><p>To better illustrate the DevOps aim and their work effort, the following figure can be created. </p></h4><h4><p>Figure 4-2 Barriers that DevOps are trying to eliminate </p></h4><p>Figure 4-2 shows the sequence that developers use to develop a product, they always strive to achieve continuous integration, which is a software development practice where developers integrate their work frequently, leading to multiple integrations per day [30]. This has shown a progress in code management within teams and a more rapid development of software. Moreover Scania IT strives to achieve continuous delivery, which is to continuously deliver improvements to an application as often as possible while maintaining quality. Lastly, is continuous deployment, which is the next step of continuous delivery. Every change that passes the automated tests is deployed to production automatically. It leads to minimizing the overall lead time. However there are several bottlenecks that will be presented below that cannot be helped with DevOps but needs the intervention of a cloud computing platform. </p><p>4.2 Bottleneck in Scania IT </p><p>After interviewing different employees in the company and understanding their current development process, it could be concluded the bottlenecks they have in the current process that they believe will be solved by adopting the cloud. </p><p><b>1.</b><b> </b><b>No standardized tool</b> between Maintenance Managers (MM) and Change Managers (CM). Since MM are using \"Jira\", while CM are using \"Remedy\". </p><p><b>2.</b><b> </b></p><h4><p>Time needed to deliver/setup a server/database is 3 weeks, since the </p></h4><p><b>hosting servers team </b></p><h4><p>must provide the servers and deliver the infrastructure which takes times.</p></h4><p><b> </b></p><p><b>3.</b><b> </b><b>Access Management</b>, they are responsible for granting access to server, servers' accounts, and active directory groups. Every order typically takes 3 days to complete. This adds to lead time. </p><p><b>4.</b><b> </b></p><h4><p>The </p></h4><p><b>CM process</b></p><h4><p> often takes a lot of time before the RFC's get approved </p></h4><p><b>5.</b><b> </b><b>Involved Dependencies</b>. Often in the development of an application, there are other teams involved in the development e.g. Integrations. They follow different time plans for development &amp; tests and which does not necessarily match with the owner of the application time plans. This adds to lead time. </p><p>6. In the change management process, the MM has a duty to send an RFC request to the Change management (CM). However there are several types of RFC that are available in the system \"Remedy\". One of the bottlenecks is the wrong usage of the RFC type that can make conflicts in the process and prolong the process. </p><p>These bottlenecks have made the teams such as the .net development team, which is responsible for several applications that use the .net development tool to think about the cloud computing solution. Since all these lead times have affected the continuous delivery that the teams are trying to achieve, the cloud seems to be a perfect solution. The cloud can decrease the lead time with both hosting server team that takes up to 3 weeks to deliver/setup a sever or database and time for the access management that takes 3days/request to grant access for the employees to their servers. Since if a company buys IaaS, then they have the servers delivered by the cloud provider instantly and the access is also done automatically. So it could be concluded that the cloud would decrease the lead time with the fast delivery of the servers and granting access automatically. </p><p>However in the next chapter, there will be a discussion about the risks of the cloud with a focus on vendor lock-in and the lock-in effects. </p><h2><p>5. Three types of lock-in effects that cause vendor lock-in </p></h2><p>Most companies look at the positive side of the cloud and the ways to move into the cloud, but never take into consideration the ways out of the cloud. In order to evaluate the way out of the cloud, the vendor lock-in and lock-in effects need to be described. </p><p>Vendor lock-in is the situation that makes customers who are adopting a cloud platform from a cloud vendor to be locked-in to that specific vendor. This situation can cause complications for the customer to move to another vendor in terms of cost, effort and time. On the other hand, the lock-in effects are the effects that cause vendor lock-in. These effects are portability, interoperability and federation. </p><p>5.1 Lock-in effects </p><p>There are several cloud providers that offer different services, storage, infrastructure, API and etcetera. Therefore, there must be a way to identify the most suitable cloud provider to a specific company such as Scania IT. A cloud provider can be chosen according to many factors such as security related to that cloud provider; another main issue is the cloud portability and interoperability. Most companies think about the advantages and the ease to the adoption of the cloud but never take into consideration their way out of the cloud and the difficulty it could cause for the companies in terms of time, effort and money. Therefore cloud portability and interoperability are the important issues discussed in this chapter since many cloud customers forget taking this into account when adopting cloud providers. Therefore, it is needed for cloud customers to consider the lock-in effects that cause vendor lock-in to try to avoid them, where the risk is being tied to a particular cloud service provider due to the difficulty and costs of switching to another cloud provider to use the equivalent cloud services [18]. </p><p>Cloud computing often relates to data, application, platform, and infrastructure components. Data is the machine-processable representation of information, which is found in the computer storage [17]. Applications are software programs that perform functions that are related to business problems [17]. Platforms are programs that support the applications and perform generic functions that are not business-related. Infrastructure is a collection of physical computation, storage, and communication resources [17]. </p><p>Portability </p><p>Portability is the ability to move applications, data, and tools from one cloud provider to another so that it is usable in the target provider. This is found in a company that wants to adopt a cloud provider such as like Scania IT. There are several types of portability such as data, application and platform portability. </p><p>Interoperability </p><p>IEEE [20] and ISO [21] define interoperability as the ability for public clouds, private clouds or other more systems within a company to exchange information and mutually use the information that has been exchanged. </p><p>In cloud computing, the most important thing with interoperability is the ability of cloud customers' service to interact with cloud provider services and be able to communicate with the components on both sides [18]. They usually interact and communicate using a specific interface or an API. The problem is that cloud providers have different interfaces for each cloud service, which deal with different functions for example administration interfaces, billing interfaces, and many more interfaces. There are many types of interoperability such as application interoperability, platform interoperability and management interoperability. </p><p>Cloud Federation </p><p>Federation is when several cloud providers are brought together to create a solution for a company. Federation is referred to the unionization of software, infrastructure and platform services from different networks that are accessed by the customer though the internet [35]. Federation of the cloud resources are facilitated through network gateways that connect public or external clouds, private or internal clouds to create a hybrid cloud computing environment. </p><p>5.2 Vendor lock-in types in relation to different cloud models </p><p>Vendor lock-in is a risk that companies need to take into consideration when adopting a cloud provider. The risk can be found in different cloud service models, in IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. The risk varies greatly depending on the cloud service model as shown in the figure 5-1. This depends greatly on the number of hardware and software the vendor provides to the customer. </p><p>Figure 5-1 The risk level of different cloud service models </p><p>IaaS depends on the specific infrastructure services that are used. For example, if the customer uses cloud storage, they will not be impacted by the non-compatible virtual machine formats [36]. IaaS vendor lock-in has the lowest risk involved because most vendors use the same virtualization environments, which makes it easier for customers to move between cloud providers [29]. </p><p>The risk increases with PaaS, since the vendor providers both hardware and software applications [29]. PaaS lock-in occurs at both the API layer and at the component level. For example, PaaS providers offers highly efficient back-end data store, that makes forces customer to develop code using the custom APIs offered by the provider and code data access routines in a way that is compatible with the back-end data store [36]. Accordingly, even if the APIs that are offered are compatible, the access model may be different, making the code unportable across PaaS providers. Moreover, PaaS lock-in at the API layer happens as different providers offer different APIs. Finally, the highest risk is with SaaS, since the vendor controls all the key components of the customers system [29]. </p><p>0\n</p><p>15\n</p><p>30\n</p><p>45\n</p><p>60\n</p><p>75\n</p><p>IaaS PaaS SaaS\n</p><h4><p>High risk </p></h4><h4><p>Low risk </p></h4><h2><p>6. Is Scania IT vulnerable to vendor lock-in? </p></h2><p>This chapter is concluding whether Scania IT is vulnerable to vendor lock-in and gathering information that can be used to evaluate why Scania IT might be vulnerable. This is done by analyzing the cloud provider they want to adopt, which is Microsoft Azure and having an interview to a similar company, in such of the same motivation to use cloud computing, and the current components that are being used. This analysis has been done to learn what the greatest challenge to make this move was and how they handled the vendor lock-in situation. </p><p>6.1 Microsoft Azure view on vendor lock-in </p><p>It was mainly focused on the lock-in effects and how a company falls in vendor lock-in. The issues that can be concluded from the meeting was that vendor lock-in should be included in a risk analysis of any company and vendor lock-in is valid regardless of whether the system is running on a physical data room of an organization or in a public cloud service such as Azure. </p><p>Azure is a platform with very many different services where it varies how easy it is to move in a solution. In Azure, they are always working to minimize the lock-in effects. Azure's Cloud OS strategy is built to be able to manage their platforms in the same way as if it is on-premises, a partner cloud provider or in Azure. In Azure IaaS deals mostly with virtual machines and these are simple to be copied to other environments, i.e. no more vendor lock-in than the equivalent in its own or partner's hall. Maybe even less as Azure have well-defined public APIs. When it comes to various PaaS services, so it varies how easy it is to migrate. Everything is going to migrate but the thing to consider is how big or small the stakes are. For example Azure websites are very easy to move to a regular web server on premises. </p><p>6.2 Relation between Company X and vendor lock-in Company X1\nbegin their thoughts of the transition of cloud computing and the most convenient provider was Microsoft Azure, since the company only used Microsoft components. Company X decided not to put everything in the cloud. But accordingly to the information classifications and how important the information is and whether it is dependent on another application or not, they would decide whether it is applicable to be put in the cloud. After choosing the most convenient </p><p>1\n</p><h4><p> Company X is an international company that wanted to stay anonymous due to their privacy concerns</p></h4><p> </p><p>cloud provider, they had a testing period through which a practical test of cloud services was made and evaluation of what would the shift mean for the organization? </p><p>They found that the usage of the cloud gave them: </p><p>1) Better user experience. </p><p>2) They could store information that is accessible to the other branches in the company in other countries. </p><p>3) Web acceleration is more effective with continues loading of new process and information. </p><p>4) The same process is shared to everyone in the company. </p><p>However, some of the concerns that made the people responsible on the transition make more efforts in examining is both security issues with a public cloud and the risk of falling into vendor lock-in. In order to decrease this risk of vendor lock-in, the company thought of the idea of mirroring. This following described method was conducted to be independent on a specific cloud provider and decrease the vulnerability to fall in vendor lock-in by making an own copy of the cloud internally offering the same services with the public cloud they have bought services that are non-vendor proprietary components such as SQL Server, Oracle, Tomcat, JBoss, IIS, Apache, etcetera that can either run: </p><p>1. In IaaS cloud, where the company take care of them but run them on an instance in the cloud or spin up a complete \"image\" of the IaaS provider's application list. </p><p>2. At PaaS provider, where the components are handled by the provider and is running on one of their servers, such as Oracle, IBM and others have this kind of PaaS based on standard products that can also be run at home in a company's own data center or in the company's own data centers (in private IaaS, PaaS or traditional IT). </p><p>However Proprietary PaaS components such as Azure Blobs, Tables Azure, Azure Machine Learning, Azure Message Bus, etcetera, or AWS corresponding components can only be used in the provider's data center and you cannot move the applications that use them either to another cloud or home to the companies own data center. With this solution, the company can save data on-premises but in case of crashing there will be no way to run the data without creating an application that can take out data. Therefore company X choose to buy non-vendor proprietary cloud that is handled by the provider and based on standard components. The PaaS services are mapped in both internal and external IaaS to achieve mirroring and redundancy. Also, in case of a crash or that the operator agreement is no longer suitable. There is always a copy of data available on-premises. This is </p><h4><p>illustrated in figure 6-1. Each application (App) has a runtime environment to make the customer have the possibility to stop and restart the environment as seen in the figure 6-1. </p></h4><h4><p>Figure 6-1 The method that can be used to minimize the risk of vendor lock-in </p><p>Some characteristic that need to be applied in both the internal and external cloud are: </p></h4><p><b>•</b><b> </b><b>Resource management: </b>for IaaS in cloud computing offers benefits such as scalability, quality of service, optimal utility, reduced overheads, improved throughput, reduced latency, specialized environment, cost effectiveness and simplified interface [22]. Also customer demands services and features and gets an environment in public or private cloud depending on current available resources. </p><p><b>•</b><b> </b><b>Automated provisioning:</b> it is the ability to deploy information technology by using predefined procedures that are carried out electronically without human intervention [23]. </p><p><b>•</b><b> </b><b>Adapters for different providers: </b>it is the ability that makes different software's to transfer information from a local office to different cloud providers.<b> </b></p><p>6.3 Is Scania IT Vulnerable in the transition to the cloud? </p><p>The most important question was whether Scania IT is vulnerable in the transition to the cloud was analyzed through the previous case study mentioned and the view of the cloud provider. It can be seen from the case study of the similar company previous situation before adopting the cloud, it can be seen the similarities in both companies. Scania IT is also an international company that has the same motivation to use the cloud, which is global accessibility, that the same process can be shared to everyone in the company. Moreover continuous delivery importance can be thought to be helped by the cloud through web acceleration in loading of new process and information. The decrease of time to market was an important factor to both companies, company X and Scania IT. All these factors made it interesting to learn from company X the ways they tried to solve issues with the cloud. Their main issues were security and the fear of vendor lock-in. However our main focus was on vendor lock-in and their perspective on solving it. The study has shown the way to minimize the risk of vendor lock-in by providing two Infrastructure services both internally in Scania IT and externally in the cloud provider. However, another factor that needs to be considered is the Cloud Maturity Index (CMI), how mature Scania IT is in cloud computing services. Therefore figure 6-2 below shows the different factors that have been considered to set Scania IT in Stage 1 in CMI. </p><h4><p>Figure 6-2 Cloud Maturity Index and the current situation of Scania CV AB </p></h4><p>In stage 1 (Immature): The cloud services are not used at all or very little. There is no strategy for the cloud services and the level of knowledge and ability is low. Finally there is no application consolidation, which means there is no strategy about the amount applications should move to the cloud. It is an important factor, since it decreases the number of vendors you deal with, and the number of licenses or home-built apps you manage, which can reduce complexity. </p><p>In stage 2 (Basic): There is a basic knowledge of cloud services. The use of services is purchased when the need arises and very little integration to other IT environment without a strategy. </p><p>In stage 3 (Mature): There is a strategy for cloud services and purchases are partially in accordance with it. There is probably more than one type of cloud service and perhaps more than one distribution model used. Cloud services are a natural part of the IT portfolio. </p><p>In stage 4 (Leading): The differences between cloud services and other forms of delivery are clearly defined. It includes whether an analysis of the existing IT portfolio has been implemented. Purchase of cloud services is in accordance with a defined strategy. Several types of cloud services and distribution models are used, depending on what is best for each area. The drivers of cloud services is particularly change, innovation and development. After the detailed view of the stages, the author of the report views Scania IT as in stage 1, since there is no use of cloud services yet. Moreover there is no defined strategy of the applications needed to move to the cloud. However it can be concluded that stage 3 can be reached fast and easily if there is a cloud defined strategy and purchases are done according to that strategy. </p><p>To clarify the current strategies in Scania IT, a flowchart has been made in figure 6-3 to ease what is needed from organizations. To be able to create a strategy, an IT strategy must be clarified. Once that is done, companies need to set their applications to be cloud defined. Cloud defined means that the applications requirements are specified and clarified with which service model suits these applications. Another requirement is the application consolidation, which is to bring several applications together to benefit of the decrease of number of vendors the company would deal with, and the number of licenses or home-built apps the company manage, can reduce complexity. Finally the last point was to clarify which requirements are needed when moving application from on-premises to the cloud, whether there are any guidelines set in a company or not. </p><p>It has been concluded that within Scania IT there are few guidelines that state which applications are most suitable to be put on the cloud in terms of simplicity, flexibility and information classification. However there are some points missing such as the need for the applications, whether they will need IaaS, PaaS or SaaS. The number of application needed to move to the cloud. It can be seen in the flowchart in figure 6-3, with the \"No\" in cloud defined, that if Scania IT does not </p><h4><p>have a fully defined cloud strategy, they should do it to decrease the risk of cloud immaturity, have power of negotiation when they have several cloud moving to the cloud and could request an own shell in the cloud from any cloud provider. </p></h4><h4><p>Figure 6-3 Hybrid IT strategy steps needed to adopt a cloud computing platform </p></h4><h4><p>These guidelines that are listed below would minimize the risk of the usage of the cloud. It is advisable for companies to work with improving their strategies before using the cloud services. Some of the guidelines currently being looked at are listed in the next subsection. </p></h4><h3><p>Guidelines</p></h3><p> </p><p>Scania IT has a Hybrid IT strategy focus that is managed by Strategic Architecture Council (SAC). SAC is a part of Scania's Enterprise Architecture Governance structure. This council is responsible for Principles and strategies, Enterprise Architecture Roadmap Strategic. Some guidelines and thought by Magnus Eriksson, who is a senior Enterprise and IT-Architect at the Enterprise Architecture Office in Scania IT AB. He has performed proactive strategy and technology investigations. </p><p>The guidelines that will be discussed below are still not accepted by the IT Development Meeting (ITDM), which is part of the Scania IT Technology Architecture decision structure. The meeting is facilitated by Scania Enterprise Architecture Office. They are responsible to accept and decide on new strategic plans. </p><p>Simplicity Guidelines </p><p>One of the important features that should be considered when choosing a deployment model and IT architecture is Simplicity. Two factors are most important when considering deployment models, which are the number and complexity of integration, and location of data producer and consumer [31]. In case of the existence of both the producer and consumer of data for a particular system are internal itself adds unnecessary complexity to deploy the system externally and vice versa for a system with external producers and consumers [31]. As seen in figure 6-4, the high risk is noticed to be when many/complex integration are in a system and the producer and consumer are not externally , then it is not a good idea to put the system externally. Also there is high risk when the producer and consumer are internal, and the systems with some/normal integrations are put externally. In most other cases there is no risk or medium risk to put the system internal or external depending on the integration complexity. So to conclude, if both the producer and consumer of data for a particular system are internal it adds unnecessary complexity to deploy the system externally and vice versa for a system with external producers and consumers [31]. </p><p> <b>Producer and consumer are external</b> </p><p><b>Producer external and consumer are Internal</b> </p><p><b>Producer internal and consumer are external</b> </p><p><b>Producer and consumer internal</b> </p><p><b>Many/comple x integrations </b></p><p><b>External External</b> <b>External</b> <b>External</b> </p><p><b>Internal Internal</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>Internal</b> </p><p><b>Some/normal integrations </b></p><p><b>External External</b> <b>External</b> <b>External</b> </p><p><b>Internal Internal</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>Internal</b> </p><p><b>Few/simple integrations </b></p><p><b>External External</b> <b>External</b> <b>External</b> </p><p><b>Internal Internal</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>Internal</b> </p><p><b>Green: Proceed. Take this as the default approach and move forward on the basis of why </b><b><i>wouldn't</i></b><b> you do it. </b></p><p><b>Amber: Medium risk. Pause and review the options available moving forward on the basis of why </b><b><i>would </i></b><b>you do it.</b> </p><p><b>Red: High-risk and/or not a good fit. Stop and consider the implications carefully before proceeding.</b> </p><h4><p>Figure 6-4 Complexity integrations in relation to whether the producer and consumer exist internally or externally. </p></h4><p>Flexibility Guidelines </p><p>Flexibility, which is the main focus of our topic since it is related to portability of moving applications between cloud vendors with as little effort and cost as possible [31]. </p><p>Therefore, the following priorities of guidelines are essential to when buying or reusing components/systems [31]: </p><p>1. Available for both internal and external deployment (outsourced, SaaS, PaaS or using IaaS). The greater the number of available external providers the better. </p><p>2. Available for external deployment from two or more external provider (outsourced, SaaS, PaaS or deployable using IaaS). The greater the number of external providers the better </p><p>3. Available only internally. </p><p>4. Available only from one external provider. </p><p>To sum up, the priority is that several components/systems are found in both external and internal deployment models, with a great number of available external providers. Then for less priority the components/systems would be available only for several external providers. After that it is preferable that components/systems are available only internally rather than externally. </p><h4><p>Information Security (ISEC) Guidelines </p><p>The information Classification in Scania IT is classified into four main classes: </p></h4><p><b>1.</b><b> </b><b>Secret </b></p><p><b>2.</b><b> </b><b>Confidential </b></p><p><b>3.</b><b> </b><b>Internal </b></p><p><b>4.</b><b> </b><b>Public </b></p><p>Both <b>Secret </b>and <b>Public</b> are rarely used in Scania IT. However when choosing a deployment model, it can be stated that a high risk application that needs to carefully be looked into to whether move to a cloud or not is in the <b>Secret </b>class. While in the <b>Confidential</b> class, it is a medium risk and options of the external providers available must be examined properly. For both<b> Internal</b> and <b>Public</b> class, both external and internal deployment models are of no risk. This can be seen in figure 6-5 [31]. </p><p><b>Confidentiality Delivery Model</b> </p><p><b>Secret External</b> </p><p><b>Internal</b> </p><p><b>Confidential External</b> </p><p><b>Internal</b> </p><p><b>Internal External</b> </p><p><b>Internal</b> </p><p><b>Public External</b> </p><p><b>Internal</b> </p><p><b>Green: Proceed. Take this as the default approach and move forward on the basis of why </b><b><i>wouldn't</i></b><b> you do it. </b></p><p><b>Amber: Medium risk. Pause and review the options available moving forward on the basis of why </b><b><i>would </i></b><b>you do it.</b> </p><p><b>Red: High-risk and/or not a good fit. Stop and consider the implications carefully before proceeding.</b> </p><h4><p>6-5 Classifications of information types followed by their risk level [31] </p></h4><p>According to the strategies that were stated above it can be concluded that the hybrid IT cloud is the main focus of the company. It can be noted that \"Hybrid IT is transforming IT architectures and the role of IT itself\", according to Gartner, Inc. [32]. Hybrid IT is the result of combing traditional IT with Hybrid Cloud, which can include public clouds, private clouds and community clouds. Hybrid </p><p>IT is new and IT organization such as Scania IT need to use a hybrid IT strategy that not only build internal clouds to house critical IT services but also utilities the external cloud to house noncritical IT services to minimize the risk of vendor lock-in by having both internal and external applications, data and information. Also further strategies are needed to minimize vulnerabilities that cause companies to fall in vendor lock-in and in the same way take the advantages that the cloud would give the company. </p><h2><p>7. Conclusion, Implications and Future work </p></h2><h4><p>This final chapter concludes and summarizes the study conducted in Scania CV AB with the goal to help Scania IT understand the vendor lock-in and the vulnerabilities they can face in the transition to the cloud. Then further work is clarified with ideas of how the work can progress. </p></h4><h4><p>7.1 Conclusion </p></h4><p> </p><p>Scania CV AB has a history over 100 years. Throughout the years, Scania has delivered heavy transport and buses with continuous development and innovations. The goal of the thesis was to emphasize the reason why Scania IT needs to consider the deployment of a cloud computing platform and to help Scania IT understand the vulnerabilities towards vendor lock-in in the transition to the cloud as well as to clarify the concern that they may have against falling in vendor lock-in and show what can be done to decrease the risks of cloud computing. The following was the research questions that were researched in the thesis. </p><p><b>(1)</b><b> </b><b> Why is cloud computing a raised issue in Scania IT? </b></p><p><b>(2)</b><b> </b><b> Why is Scania IT vulnerable to vendor lock-in in the transition to a cloud computing platform? </b></p><p><b>(3)</b><b> </b><b> Why is vendor lock-in a concern to Scania IT when using a cloud computing platform? </b></p><p>The requirement of a cloud computing platform was needed to minimize the lead-time caused in the current development process. The cloud computing platform is the technology where the servers and applications are hosted on the internet rather than internally on premises. The advantages of a cloud computing platform is flexibility, innovation, development and less IT costs that are due to reduced amount of physical infrastructure that they have to keep and maintain. There are several characteristics of the cloud, which are service models IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. Also a set of deployment models public cloud, virtual private cloud, private cloud and hybrid cloud that can be chosen from. These characteristics can be chosen depending on the companies' requirement that </p><p>they have set on their applications. The development process that Scania IT is going through all the way to production was to conclude the bottlenecks that Scania IT was facing and the benefits of moving the cloud. </p><p>Most companies like Scania IT have seen the advantages and positive side of moving to the cloud and the ways into the cloud, but never have taken into consideration the ways out of the cloud. Therefore the study was mainly focused on the vulnerabilities causing vendor lock-in, which is the situation that causes companies to be locked to a specific cloud provider and moving to another provider will cause the company to pay significant switching costs. The situation of vendor lock-in was examined by analyzing a similar company with the same criteria and motivation to move to the cloud and from that analysis, it was concluded that vendor lock-in can be minimized by creating two infrastructures as a service, one internally and one externally to have duplicate of the data and avoiding using proprietary cloud provider components. Other risks were taken into account and that was the cloud maturity index (CMI) and how mature Scania IT can be seen in cloud computing. The conclusion was that Scania IT needs to improve their knowledge about cloud services and decide which cloud deployment model is most appropriate to their companies business. The index of cloud maturity is an important factor since companies with high CMI has in average 34 % less costs for IT and spend three times more on innovation and development. </p><p>Moreover it could be concluded that the most suitable deployment model is the Hybrid IT, instead of only using one development model. Thus the benefits and limitations of all deployment models are taken. However a study of the Hybrid IT strategies in Scania IT is needed to evaluate how mature Scania IT is in cloud computing. Strategies has shown that deploying the Infrastructure with the help of the cloud, is the much more beneficial for Scania IT than to deploy platform services, which will increase their risk to vendor lock-in and would not give so huge gain in the company but more risk. </p><p>Scania IT needs to consider the risk of vendor lock-in and the lock-in effects as portability, interoperability and federation that causes the applications not to be runnable at another cloud provider. By solving the lock-in effects, the company is minimizing the vendor lock-in since that is solving portability of data from one cloud provider to another, or interoperability, that the applications from different vendors are communicating to each other or federation, where different applications from different providers form a solution for a company. </p><p>However, it might be necessary to first move the data back to the customer's site and then move it to the new provider's environment using a data migration plan. In this migration plan, there must be a way to switch data format and syntax to another form to be suitable to be used by another provider. Since Scania IT is a huge international company with much valuable data and information, it would be recommended according to their classification of data to avoid putting any secret or confidential data on the cloud. The companies as Scania IT need to study and research all the cloud possibilities with the advantages and disadvantages of the cloud to avoid falling in vendor lock-in. Also by reaching a leading stage in the CMI that can help the company be aware of all the cloud elements, risks and follow a defined strategy. The vulnerabilities that Scania IT can face towards vendor lock-in is lack of standard technologies and solutions, poor provider selection, lack of supplier redundancy, lack of completeness and transparency in terms of use. Since all the cloud providers want to lock their customers to their own components and do not support standardization of technologies and solutions. Also, cloud providers do not provide all the information to their customer which contributes to lack of transparency. </p><p>7.2 Implications for Scania IT </p><p>Scania CV AB is an international company, which seeks innovations and continuous development in their trucks and buses for heavy transport work. As stated before the study was particularly done in Scania IT, which is the part of Scania CV AB that is responsible for the development of the applications and their infrastructure. </p><p>Their need for the cloud was concluded from their bottlenecks that were derived from the development process. The study clarified the need for the cloud for Scania IT and made them realize the advantages of the movement of the cloud. However, the cons of the cloud as vendor lock-in was noticed as a risk for the company that they fear in using cloud computing. Despite of this fear, the clarifications of the different lock-in effects were helpful for Scania IT to understand what they need to discuss with cloud providers. Furthermore Scania IT needs to further work on the steps for their exit strategy of moving out of the cloud computing platform if needed. </p><p>The case study of company X that has similar characteristics as Scania IT, gave Scania IT a solution that would minimize the risk of vendor lock-in while maintaining the advantages of the cloud as flexibility and lower IT costs. Scania IT thought the idea of using two infrastructures as service was brilliant and would be minimize their concern about vendor lock-in as they would have their data on-premises. This is seen as an advantage since IaaS has a fixed fee that can expand easily with minimal operational and maintenance expenditure. So for a big company as Scania IT with 42,100 employees, it will be much easier to automate by saving on the public IaaS and a private IaaS to protect data either by security propose if the public cloud will have any break in or something and Scania IT wants to get their data or by the private cloud, where Scania IT can just take their data and use it on another PaaS. </p><p>Another important aspect for Scania IT was the<i> cloud maturity index</i>, that shows how mature a company is in using cloud computing. This index has shown Scania IT their current position and what is needed for them to reach a higher mature stage and minimize their risks. This index led to the discussion whether Scania IT has a cloud defined strategy. Cloud defined strategy was an important issue for Scania IT to follow in order to reach their goal to use cloud computing platform. </p><p>7.3 Future work </p><p>Cloud computing is a broad developing topic with a lot of room for further research and analysis. There are two approaches for future work, one for Scania IT and one for general researchers. </p><p>For Scania IT, this study concludes an overview for the reasons that can cause the company Scania IT to think about the usage of cloud computing platform and the risk of vendor lock-in. This work can be continued in different aspects. One of these aspects is to further study the Hybrid IT strategies in terms of the applications needed to move to the cloud. Besides that, they need to consider each application requirement, whether it requires the implementation of IaaS, PaaS or SaaS. Another aspect that needs further research is the guideline of different cloud provider in terms of their offering for portability and interoperability of data and applications. </p><p>For general researchers, this study is the ways to minimize the risk of vendor lock-in and strategies that can be worked upon to achieve a higher leading CMI. This work can be continued by evaluating the different cloud provider's capabilities of offerings for portability and interoperability. </p><p>Also, to further look into further solutions of vendor lock-in and the new technologies and standardization techniques that are striving to make vendor lock-in a decreased risk for companies. </p><h2><p>References </p></h2><p>[1] Scania.

Cloud computing is a term that refers to a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data, rather than on a local server or a personal computer. Vendor lock-in is an outcome that causes companies to pay a significant cost to move between cloud providers. The effects that cause vendor lock-in that will be described are portability, interoperability and federation are called the lock-in effects. The goal of the research is to help Scania IT understand the vendor lock-in and the vulnerabilities they can face in the transition to the cloud as well as to clarify the concern that they may have against falling in vendor lock-in. The main purpose of the research is to present the various lock-in effects that are related to the transition from one cloud provider to another and the vulnerabilities that cause companies to fall in vendor lock-in. The thesis presents the reasons that motivates why Scania IT would consider using the cloud and the concerns that they may have against usage of a cloud computing platform. The results will be based on a case study of a similar company that has moved to a cloud provider and specifically Microsoft Azure and an interview of Microsoft Azure point of view with the risk of vendor lock-in. Finally, a process of interviews with different people from Scania IT to extract the current bottleneck in the development process that caused the company to think of a cloud computing platform. The results show that companies should consider many risks and factors while moving to the cloud, as vendor lock-in, cloud maturity index and their IT strategies. As a result, the thesis gives recommendations of the steps needed to minimize the risks of the cloud while maintaining the positivity of the cloud.\n\nKeywords: Cloud computing, vendor lock-in, lock-in effects, portability, interoperability, federation, Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, Infrastructure as a Service.\n\nSammanfattning\n\nUppsatsen presenterar en studie om de sårbarheter som ett företag som Scania IT har mot inlåsning i övergången till molntjänster. Molntjänster är en term som hänvisar till ett nätverk av servrar som finns på internet för att lagra, hantera och processa data, istället för på en lokal server eller en persondator. Inlåsning är ett resultat i vilket orsakar att företagen behöver betala en betydande kostnad för att flytta mellan molnleverantörer. De effekter som orsakar inlåsning vilket kommer att beskrivas är portabilitet, interoperabilitet och federation, dessa kallas inlåsningseffekter. Målet med forskningen är att hjälpa Scania IT att förstå inlåsning och sårbarheter som de kan möta i övergången till molnet. Dessutom är målet att klarlägga riskerna som de kan ha mot att falla i inlåsning. Det huvudsakliga syftet med forskningen är att presentera de olika inlåsningseffekter som är relaterade till övergången från en molnleverantör till en annan samt de sårbarheter som orsakar företagen att falla i inlåsning. Uppsatsen presenterar skäl som motiverar varför Scania IT ska överväga att använda molnet samt den oro som de kan ha mot användning av en molnleverantör. Resultaten kommer att baseras på en fallstudie av ett liknande företag som har flyttat till en molnleverantör och specifikt Microsoft Azure samt en intervju av Microsoft Azure synvinkel med risken för inlåsning. Slutligen, en rad av intervjuer med olika personer från Scania IT för att extrahera den nuvarande flaskhalsen i utvecklingsprocessen som orsakade företaget att tänka på molntjänster. Resultaten visar att företagen bör överväga många risker och faktorer när de flyttar till molnet, som exempelvis inlåsning, cloud maturity index och deras IT-strategier. Som ett resultat ger examensarbetet nödvändiga rekommendationer för att minimera riskerna för molnet samtidigt som positivitet av molnet.\n\nNykelord: Cloud computing, vendor lock-in, lock-in effects, portability, interoperability, federation, Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, Infrastructure as a Service.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis Master thesis is the last part of my degree program in Information and Communication Technology at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.

Since that time, Scania has built and delivered more than 1,400,000 trucks and buses for heavy transport work [1]. Scania IT is a part of Scania CV AB, which is responsible for the development of the applications and handling infrastructure of Scania CV AB. Scania IT are currently having all their work and infrastructure on-premises. So currently Scania IT is looking for a better economical and flexible solution, with the aim to decrease time to market. Therefore Scania IT is considering implementing a cloud computing platform, since they assume it will lead to reaching globally faster and will contribute to continuous delivery, which is an important goal to Scania IT that they are always striving to achieve with optimization. Many concerns are listed within Scania IT in the transition to the cloud such as security issues, lack of control and reliability. However the main concern that they want to analyze is vendor lock-in and the vulnerabilities that cause the companies to fall in vendor lock-in. Vendor lock-in is the outcome that makes a customer dependent on a specific vendor for products and services unable to use another vendor without substantial switching costs. Therefore the thesis will present a study about this main concern to Scania IT in moving to a cloud computing platform.\n\n1.1 Problem statement\n\nScania IT is seeking for improvement for the rate of delivering services and applications with providing a faster delivery rate, which contributes to continuous delivery that tries to deliver improvements to an application as often as possible while maintaining quality. Moreover, Scania IT wants to investigate deeply the many unresolved and open problems related to the mature technologies of cloud computing. One of these technologies is vendor lock-in, which is caused by the lock-in effects that will be described in this thesis such as portability, which is the ability to move applications, data, and tools from one cloud vendor to another in a company that wants to use a cloud provider such as Scania IT. Another effect is the interoperability, which is the ability for different clouds to communicate with each other. Portability and interoperability effects play a big role in causing vendor lock-in, which causes companies to pay a significant cost to move between cloud providers.\n\nMoreover, Scania CV AB is a large international company where several countries are involved to many applications that are found in Södertalje (The main office); therefore a goal they are always striving to achieve is global accessibility from around the world.\n\n1.2 Related work and contribution\n\nTo accomplish the transition to the cloud, there are many factors that need to be taken into account as shown in figure 1-1 below [2].\n\nFigure 1-1 Cloud computing pros and cons and some of the issues directed in the thesis [2]\n\nGeneral studies in the field of deployment of cloud computing bring up some ongoing discussions. Figure 1-1 above shows that there are four main cons to cloud computing which are security, lock-in, lack of control and reliability [2].\n\nSince cloud computing is a big technological aim to provide flexibility and economic improvement to companies and customers. For companies to use cloud computing, they need to discuss and research these benefits versus the risks of cloud computing. Therefore a literature study has been conducted to provide an empirical investigation of cloud computing using multiple sources of evidence and in-depth analysis of several previous studies.\n\nGreenwood et al [3] showed that cloud computing can be significantly cheaper alternative to purchasing and maintaining system infrastructure in-house. Despite these advantages, he showed that there are some important socio-technical issues that need to be considered before organizations would move their IT systems to the cloud [3]. Petcu et al [4] have proposed a layered set of APIs that are offering a supplementary degree of freedom, from programming languages and style. Kostoska et al [5] has proposed a new cloud portability service platform and gave an overview of the current trends in the area of cloud service portability. Kostoska discussed that there are no standard solutions for cloud service portability, mainly due to a huge number of various cloud providers on the market. However, he named two approaches that are known in technology area to cope with emerging markets and offer. The first approach is using the most successful provider, which will \"kill\" the other in the concurrent market environment, and the other to establish a highly recognized standard accepted by all market players [5]. The second approach is using Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA), which represents a first step towards building a standard for portable deployment and the migration of existing applications onto a cloud [5]. Guillen et al [6] proposed a framework which aims to favour cloud agnostic software development, which helps companies continue building their applications without having to modify their technology, and also without having to choose a single immovable cloud provider. Moreover, Ranabahu et al [7] indicated that using Domain Specific Languages (DSL) shows a promise in developing portable applications for the cloud and related platforms. They have done some tests and the results shown were very promising for a portable cloud platform.\n\nIt can be concluded so far, almost all researches for cloud computing are pointed towards solutions of portability and ways to overcome vendor lock-in. However not much has been discussed about the vulnerabilities that make companies like Scania IT fall into vendor lock-in. Also, the reason why it is a concern to companies considering the usage of cloud computing. Therefore, the contribution that thesis aims to address is the existing gaps in the deployment of a cloud computing and specifically Microsoft Azure in an International huge company like Scania IT and fills the research gap, which is the lack of studies for the reasons and vulnerabilities that companies face in the deployment of a cloud provider.\n\nFurthermore, the thesis represents some ideas on how to resolve some problems faced when deploying a cloud computing platform. It is believed that the thesis research questions will be filled by the conclusions made on this project. Therefore, some research questions will be presented in order to show what would be the direction of study during different steps of this project and eventually by answering these questions the final conclusion will be made.\n\nThe main problem area is related to the title of the thesis:\n\nDespite the fact that Cloud Computing is a popular evolved computing terminology based on the consumption of computing resource and proven to be cost efficient and more flexible with a reduce in the amount of physical infrastructure that a company have to keep and maintain. However some downsides are security and vendor lock-in. So why such a technology has not been applied or discussed in huge companies like Scania CV AB?\n\nSince the previous statement is not easy to resolve, it should be cleaved:\n\n(1)  Why is the cloud a raised issue in Scania IT?\n\n(2)  Why is Scania IT vulnerable to vendor lock-in in the transition to a cloud computing platform?\n\n(3)  Why is vendor lock-in a concern to Scania IT when using a cloud computing platform?\n\nThe above order was based on a sequence that would be easy to follow. The work would start by answering the research question (1) that would lead companies to think of the positive side of the cloud. However the drawbacks of the cloud such as vendor lock-in raised questions (2) and (3) to be interesting to examine as most companies do not take into consideration the movement out of the cloud. After identifying the missing gap and the research questions, it could be derived the goal and purpose of the study in the following sub-sections.\n\n1.3 Goals\n\nThe goal of the study is to emphasize the reason why Scania IT needs to consider the deployment of a cloud computing platform and to help Scania IT understand the vendor lock-in and the associated vulnerabilities they can face in the transition to the cloud as well as to clarify the concern they may have against falling into vendor lock-in and show what can be done to decrease the risks of cloud computing.\n\n1.3.1 Benefits and Sustainability\n\nThe audience of this document are companies that want to use a cloud computing platform and want to understand more the risks rather than the benefits of cloud computing. They could use the solution proposed in the thesis to minimize the risks of vendor lock-in and benefit from the steps and ways to minimize the risks of cloud computing.\n\nSustainability aspects were also taken into account, which is reusing the work that had already been analyzed in Scania and build on it what was missing to achieve a useful thesis that can help the companies that are thinking of using a cloud computing platform. Moreover, the work submitted and analyzed can be reused by other companies to minimize the risks of cloud computing and improve companies maturity rate within cloud computing, which contributes to sustainability.\n\n1.4 Delimitations\n\nThe name of the company in the case study that has been done by interviewing the person who was involved in this transition will be stayed anonymous, due to ethical reasons and request of the owner of the information in the case study.\n\n1.5 Outline of the thesis\n\nChapter 2 presents the methodology used in performing the work. Also, gives the reader a more insight of which methods are used in this research and why they are preferable methods. The chapter gives more details of how data is collected and how the analysis of Vendor lock-in vulnerabilities is performed.\n\nChapter 3 is the start of the author contribution and presents for the reader a history and a wide introduction to cloud computing. Also, gives an introduction on the different service and deployment models. Finally, it gives an idea about two main cloud providers.\n\nChapter 4 presents the investigations that are performed in the company to understand the development process and bottlenecks that Scania IT is currently facing and give reasons why Scania IT should consider the cloud.\n\nChapter 5 presents the lock-in effects that cause vendor lock-in and the different types of vendor lock-in.\n\nChapter 6 presents the evaluations of investigations that were carried out to figure out if Scania IT is vulnerable to vendor lock-in.\n\nChapter 7 presents the conclusion with the answer to the research questions and the future work that can be done by other researchers and Scania IT.\n\n2. Method\n\nThis chapter represents the methodology and the framework of the research, data collection, selection, application and evaluation of the data collection method. The work with this thesis was divided into several stages that contributed to the final conclusion.\n\n2.1 Methodology\n\nTo perform this thesis work, given the explorative nature of the research objectives, a qualitative research method was chosen instead of quantitative method. The quantitative research method uses experiments and large data sets to reach a conclusion, while the qualitative research method uses investigations in an interpretative manner to create theories [8]. The thesis applies the qualitative method because it helps to understand the vulnerabilities that companies such as Scania IT can fall into and the lock-in effects that cause the difficulty of moving between different cloud providers. Qualitative research method answers to questions, such as why, how and what [8].\n\nResearch approaches are needed to draw conclusion and to be clear whether these conclusions are true or false. There are several methods that can be used, such as inductive, deductive or abductive approach, which includes both the latter named methods. Inductive approach is when the research resonate theories based on experiences and opinions. While, deductive approach resonate theories to verify or falsify hypotheses. Inductive approach is often used when data is collected with qualitative methods [8].\n\nThe thesis will apply inductive approach since there is no clear theory to verify or falsify hypotheses, which applies in a deductive approach. However, a deep analysis is needed to gain an understanding of the different cloud computing techniques and their effect on the company specially the lock-in effects. Also, since the outcome is based on interviews of different employees in the development process and getting an idea of how they work today when compared to working with a cloud computing platform as Microsoft Azure.\n\nThe work contribution involved several stages:\n\n1.  Literature Study\n\n2. Interviews internal and external\n\n3. Analysis of Scania intranet system\n\n4. Case Study\n\nStarting with a literature study, this is needed to analyze the present situation of the company and the current work done in this area. This analysis was performed by studying secondary data such as reports, conference presentations, online information, user guides, press releases, white papers and articles.\n\nThe second step was data collection for carrying out the study, which was by interviews. The interviews of people in the current development process of Scania IT was performed to understand the bottleneck in the process and motivate for reasons for the need of the cloud. The interviews were done by carrying out unstructured or semi-structured data collection techniques i.e. individual depth interviews and group discussions in this case. This field research consisted of interviewing developers, testers and software oriented architecture experts. The exact interviewees for this project were mainly addressed to three teams in one section of Scania IT. The process started by interviewing maintenance managers of each department in one section of the company. Then the process proceeded by interviewing a system developer and tester in that specific section. Finally, the process of interview was directed to a higher rank, which is Change Management department. Interviewing different people was done to understand the current process, then an analysis of Scania's intranet system was needed to provide a wider picture of the inner work of Scania and the structure of how they work. Then an external interview was performed with the solution lead principle for Microsoft Azure to understand their offerings for companies and their perspective on vendor lock-in.\n\nFurthermore, a case study of a company that has had the experience about transition to the cloud provider and specifically Microsoft Azure. Case studies involved reading previous experience of the adoption of the cloud and gathering information that will help make the analysis to Scania IT and solve the worries that can be found. This case study has been deducted through a semi-structured interview to one of the employees that was in charge of this transition and the questions were directed to how this company dealt with vendor lock-in. Finally, the idea of the cloud maturity index, showing how mature Scania IT is towards cloud computing led to the proposal of an IT strategy to define applications in Scania IT moving to a cloud hence lead to a higher rank of cloud maturity.\n\n2.2 Framework of the study\n\nIn order to make the work structured in a way that would be comprehensive and easy to follow. A framework was created by the author with the steps need to answer the research questions. This particular order of steps found in figure 2-1 was the order that was used to answer the research questions, which are described below in details.\n\nProblem: This is the first step in the thesis, where the problem was concluded from the current situation of Scania IT and the reasons gathered behind the study of cloud computing.\n\nRelated Work: Following the problem, the work started by reading other researchers work and extracting the related work and figuring out the thesis gap. From that literature study, the research questions were introduced.\n\nCloud Computing Theory: Then following that a deep detailed analysis of the cloud computing theory was needed to give the reader a broad understanding of cloud computing, which will be needed to understand the rest of the work.\n\nInterviews: After representing the data about cloud theory, 14 interviews from within Scania IT have been performed to understand their current development process and discuss the work and tools that are needed in each process. From these interviews, it was concluded as well the bottlenecks that Scania IT are currently facing. Ethics was taken into account in this interview research. That being said, in all interviews that were conducted it was asked to the interviewees whether it was allowed to use and reference the data given in the interview and if it was allowed to use their name and position in the thesis if needed.\n\nMicrosoft Azure Interview: That included an interview for a Principal Solutions Lead - Azure in Microsoft. That was to better understand their services and their view on vendor lock-in as leading cloud providers in both IaaS and PaaS service models.\n\nCase Study Company X: That was an important step to gather the company's opinion on vendor lock-in, where the author interviewed the person responsible about the movement to the cloud in company X. This was used to evaluate if Scania IT can follow the same pattern and avoid vendor lock-in.\n\nCloud Maturity Index: This analysis step was to evaluate what was Scania IT current situation with cloud maturity and how to move to a higher stage. Therefore a Hybrid IT strategy was created as a flowchart guideline for companies to follow in order to achieve a high maturity stage.\n\nFigure 2-1 The framework that was used in the thesis work\n\nThe green arrows illustrate that all the work performed results to the answer the research questions.\n\nThe red arrows illustrate the order of the steps taken to answer the research question starting with problem, all the way to the cloud maturity index analysis.\n\n3. Cloud Computing Theory\n\nThis chapter presents a background theory on cloud computing, cloud service models, cloud deployment models and top three cloud providers. Moreover, there will be a clarification about the difference between vendor lock-in and lock-in effects.\n\n3.1 What is Cloud Computing?\n\nCloud computing is a new terminology that was added to the IT industry in early 2007 [9]. Cloud Computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer [12].\n\nThe national Institute of Standards & Technology has defined Cloud Computing as follows [10]: \"Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.\"\n\nThese cloud service and deployment models will be discussed in the next section. However the five essential characteristics will be listed below and described [10].\n\n1. On-demand self-service: A consumer can use computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage without requiring human interaction with each service provider.\n\n2. Broad network access: Computing capabilities are available over the network and can be accessed by any device (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).\n\n3. Resource pooling: Computing resources that are owned by the cloud provider are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth.\n\n4. Rapid elasticity: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.\n\n5. Measured service: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported so providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.\n\n3.2 Cloud Service Models\n\nThere are three common service models that are represented in relation to cloud computing, which are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). These models will be represented in details below.\n\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS)\n\nInfrastructure as a Service is a service offering a focus towards those who have knowledge of how to configure the software portion of the technology stack, but do not want to manage the hardware [14]. Infrastructure is the base of the stack and provides all the raw computing resources.\n\nPlatform as a Service (PaaS)\n\nPlatform as a Service is a service aimed to developers that help them develop and test applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. Developers do not want to have to worry about provisioning the servers, storage and backup associated with developing and launching an application [15]. The platform services provide users with software, virtual machines (VMs) and usually handle all aspects of system administration for the user. On the other hand, the customers would need only to handle the applications and data as illustrated in figure 3-1.\n\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS)\n\nAnother type of cloud computing model is Software as a Service, which is a service that means that the cloud computing provider is in charge of applications, data, operating system, storage, service and the rest as shown in the figure 3-1 [2]. The consumer buys the services without worrying about the customization or maintenance of the hardware. They need to just stay connected to the cloud provider.\n\nFigure 3-1 Different models and what is managed by the company versus what is managed by the cloud provider\n\nFigure 3-1 illustrates the separation of responsibilities for on-premises versus three service models, IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, where it presents what is manageable by the cloud provider versus what is managed by the customer. So, Other manages illustrates the cloud providers as Microsoft Azure or Amazon. While You Manage, illustrates the customer as Scania IT.\n\n3.3 Cloud Deployment Models\n\nThere are five common deployment models that are represented in relation to cloud computing, which are public cloud, private cloud, private virtual cloud, community cloud and hybrid cloud.\n\nPublic Cloud\n\nA public cloud is available to the public or a large industry group and is owned by the organization selling cloud services [16]. Public cloud resources are normally provisioned on demand or on dynamic basis over the internet [16]. In the public cloud, the servers are the same for all companies in the cloud but with different structures, where different companies can share the servers. This can be shown in figure 3-2. The limitation of the public cloud is the security concerns that the cloud servers are shared by many companies. This can be motivated since many cloud servers are in the\n\nsame cloud infrastructure and therefore there is a lot of resources that are shared among the different companies that can be found in the cloud.\n\nPrivate Cloud\n\nA private cloud provides an easy, flexible and effective way to request, use and deploy IT resources, applications and virtual machines (VMs) on hardware that is dedicated to a single organization [11]. It can exist on premises or off premises [16]. The private cloud is an emulation of the public cloud, typically on a private network, and exists to support the goals of the organization, rather than to generically support resources for multiple organizations [16]. Private cloud customers have their own servers and ports. This is illustrated in figure 3-2. The limitation of the private cloud is that it can be more expensive than a public cloud. Since each cloud infrastructure is particularly to one cloud consumer and therefore nothing is shared with other consumers making it more expensive when compared to the public cloud.\n\nVirtual private cloud\n\nAn alternative solution to addressing the limitations of both public and private clouds is called Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). VPC is where the cloud is present in a cloud provider data center such as Amazon, Azure data center, where each server has its own network of companies' information. It\n\nuses a multi-tenant shared services model as the public cloud but the partitions a single instance of resources are for an individual customer. VPC customers \"share\" the core cloud platform but the virtual machines they use are dedicated for their own private use, which makes it more isolated than the public cloud and the user has complete control over their virtual networking environment, including selection of their own IP address range, creation of subnets. This also allows customers to design their own security firewalls when compared to the public cloud limitation. However the limitation in VPC is the use multi-tenant, while many customers prefer the use of single-tenant. Since there is a fear of sharing other customers the core cloud platform.\n\nCommunity Cloud\n\nA Community cloud is shared by several organizations to support a specific community, which is only accessible for these organizations [10]. The infrastructure can be operated and owned by the cloud provider or the organization. These communities would most probably share privacy and performance requirements. The limitation that can be found is the sharing of the cloud platform as the public and virtual private cloud. If there is no trust between the organizations using the cloud, there can be a risk of information leakage. Also, to provide resources and a cloud computing infrastructure to the community requires a huge amount of investment, which can limit the resources to the organization making them less wanting to share the cloud and use the community cloud.\n\nHybrid Cloud\n\nA Hybrid cloud is the combination of two different methods of resource pooling; it could be two cloud deployment models like public with community [10]. This combination of two or more cloud providers is remained as a unique entity that is bound together by standardized technology that allows data and applications portability [16]. Hybrid cloud is one of the best solutions, where it includes many deployment models with the benefits and limitations of each.\n\nWhile a Hybrid IT is the result of combining internal and external services, usually from a combination of internal and public clouds, in support of a business outcome [33]. The comparison can be better illustrated in figure 3-2. Hybrid IT includes traditional IT with all the cloud deployment models (Hybrid cloud) shown below.\n\nFigure 3-2 Different delivery models and illustrates the Hybrid cloud and Hybrid IT [31]\n\n3.4 Cloud Providers\n\nCloud providers are a company that provides cloud computing services and solutions to customers, which can be individuals or businesses. The cloud provider delivers solutions that are pay-as-you-go, meaning that the customers need only to pay while using such services. These solutions are the ones named in the previous chapter, which are IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. The two providers that are discussed are Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are top leading providers in different cloud models. Amazon is leading in IaaS services and Microsoft Azure has become a leader since 2014 in both IaaS and PaaS services [25; 26]. This information was published by Gartner [25; 26] and the charts can be found in appendix A.\n\nMicrosoft Azure\n\nMicrosoft Azure is the cloud provider that Scania IT wants to adopt. Microsoft Azure is Microsoft's cloud platform [34], which is a growing collection of integrated service such as compute, storage, data, networking, and applications that help the customer move faster, do more, and save money [34]. Azure is an industry leader for both IaaS and PaaS services as ranked by Gartner [25; 26; 34]. IaaS and PaaS combined together give services that let customers build, deploy, and manage applications any way you like for unmatched productivity [34].\n\nAmazon Web services (AWS)\n\nAmazon web services were founded by Bezo in 1994 as an online book store [27] and in year 2002, it was officially one of the top 500 companies in US [27]. Amazon is the leading provider in IaaS services as ranked by Gartner [25; 26]. They have several PaaS services that have been introduced in 2011 such as \"elastic beanstalk\" [28], which allow users to create application and push them into a defined set of AWS services.\n\n4. Current development process and bottleneck in Scania IT\n\nThis chapter is done by investigating the current development process that Scania IT is currently going through all the way to production. Then, concludes with the bottlenecks that have made Scania IT think about the adoption of the cloud platform. The aim of this chapter was to understand the development process and the vulnerabilities that Scania IT is currently facing and whether it can be solved by using the cloud.\n\n4.1 Current development process\n\nA study of the current development process of Scania IT was needed to evaluate the process that Scania IT is currently using and the tools they use for their applications. The current development process was gathered by interviewing a group of people working in Scania IT and in the process of change management process which is name of the process that Scania IT is working with to deliver products.\n\nThe development process goes through several procedures. The development process starts by having a Change Request (CR), meaning that a request to change for an application served to a customer, which is Scania. The CR can be a change in an application or an upgrade of Scania's database. Then after figuring out the start of the process, the work started by interviewing three different maintenance managers (MM), which are responsible for handling the CR. MM are also in charge of the control of installation, repair and upkeep of employers' property, including machines and mechanical systems. They may also take on more administrative tasks, depending on the specifics of their job. Then moving to a higher rank that is change management department. MM currently uses a system called \"Jira\", which is an issue tracking product on Scania that is used for Trouble Reports (TRs) and Change Requests (CRs) made during software development, maintenances and projects alike. MM handles CRs within the team, which means that the MM has discussed with the developers and testers who will be responsible about that specific change.\n\nA Request for Change (RFC) is issued by the MM on a system called \"Remedy\", which is handled by the Change management (CM), responsible. Therefore an interview to the person responsible was conducted to understand more about their system and their process. CM is in charge of minimizing the number, and impact, of incidents caused by planned changes to the Scania IT service production environment. Also, to ensure that all IT services are carefully prepared for a safe and secure operation. When the CM has agreed on the change, the application needed to be changed is done and moves to the stage of production. This is shown in details in figure 4-1 below. The steps can be summarized with respect to the figure:\n\n1. Scania CV AB, the customer issues a change request (CR) to Maintenance Managers (MM).\n\n2. After MM register in\"Jira\" system, they issue a Request for Change (RFC) through a system called \"Remedy\" to the Change Management team (CM).\n\n3. The CM looks at the editing and does the necessary things as written in the figure 4-1. After approval about the quality, risk analysis and other things, they send the CR to production to take care of it.\n\nFigure 4-1 Development process of Scania IT\n\nIn between the MM and the CM, DevOps can be found as shown in the figure 4-2. Two DevOps in the Scania IT were interviewed to understand their role in the process. DevOps comes from the combinations of the initials of Developers and Operations. They are in charge of decreasing the gap between developers and operations by synchronizing the methods and tools used between both. As seen in figure No. There was a further interview conducted to the creator of this process and the one responsible about continuous updates to the process. He talked about his continuous effort along\n\nwith his team to optimize the change management process and ease the process to help Scania IT workers to delivery faster with the aim of continuous delivery.\n\nTo better illustrate the DevOps aim and their work effort, the following figure can be created.\n\nFigure 4-2 Barriers that DevOps are trying to eliminate\n\nFigure 4-2 shows the sequence that developers use to develop a product, they always strive to achieve continuous integration, which is a software development practice where developers integrate their work frequently, leading to multiple integrations per day [30]. This has shown a progress in code management within teams and a more rapid development of software. Moreover Scania IT strives to achieve continuous delivery, which is to continuously deliver improvements to an application as often as possible while maintaining quality. Lastly, is continuous deployment, which is the next step of continuous delivery. Every change that passes the automated tests is deployed to production automatically. It leads to minimizing the overall lead time. However there are several bottlenecks that will be presented below that cannot be helped with DevOps but needs the intervention of a cloud computing platform.\n\n4.2 Bottleneck in Scania IT\n\nAfter interviewing different employees in the company and understanding their current development process, it could be concluded the bottlenecks they have in the current process that they believe will be solved by adopting the cloud.\n\n1. No standardized tool between Maintenance Managers (MM) and Change Managers (CM). Since MM are using \"Jira\", while CM are using \"Remedy\".\n\n2.\n\nTime needed to deliver/setup a server/database is 3 weeks, since the\n\nhosting servers team\n\nmust provide the servers and deliver the infrastructure which takes times.\n\n3. Access Management, they are responsible for granting access to server, servers' accounts, and active directory groups. Every order typically takes 3 days to complete. This adds to lead time.\n\n4.\n\nThe\n\nCM process\n\noften takes a lot of time before the RFC's get approved\n\n5. Involved Dependencies. Often in the development of an application, there are other teams involved in the development e.g. Integrations. They follow different time plans for development & tests and which does not necessarily match with the owner of the application time plans. This adds to lead time.\n\n6. In the change management process, the MM has a duty to send an RFC request to the Change management (CM). However there are several types of RFC that are available in the system \"Remedy\". One of the bottlenecks is the wrong usage of the RFC type that can make conflicts in the process and prolong the process.\n\nThese bottlenecks have made the teams such as the .net development team, which is responsible for several applications that use the .net development tool to think about the cloud computing solution. Since all these lead times have affected the continuous delivery that the teams are trying to achieve, the cloud seems to be a perfect solution. The cloud can decrease the lead time with both hosting server team that takes up to 3 weeks to deliver/setup a sever or database and time for the access management that takes 3days/request to grant access for the employees to their servers. Since if a company buys IaaS, then they have the servers delivered by the cloud provider instantly and the access is also done automatically. So it could be concluded that the cloud would decrease the lead time with the fast delivery of the servers and granting access automatically.\n\nHowever in the next chapter, there will be a discussion about the risks of the cloud with a focus on vendor lock-in and the lock-in effects.\n\n5. Three types of lock-in effects that cause vendor lock-in\n\nMost companies look at the positive side of the cloud and the ways to move into the cloud, but never take into consideration the ways out of the cloud. In order to evaluate the way out of the cloud, the vendor lock-in and lock-in effects need to be described.\n\nVendor lock-in is the situation that makes customers who are adopting a cloud platform from a cloud vendor to be locked-in to that specific vendor. This situation can cause complications for the customer to move to another vendor in terms of cost, effort and time. On the other hand, the lock-in effects are the effects that cause vendor lock-in. These effects are portability, interoperability and federation.\n\n5.1 Lock-in effects\n\nThere are several cloud providers that offer different services, storage, infrastructure, API and etcetera. Therefore, there must be a way to identify the most suitable cloud provider to a specific company such as Scania IT. A cloud provider can be chosen according to many factors such as security related to that cloud provider; another main issue is the cloud portability and interoperability. Most companies think about the advantages and the ease to the adoption of the cloud but never take into consideration their way out of the cloud and the difficulty it could cause for the companies in terms of time, effort and money. Therefore cloud portability and interoperability are the important issues discussed in this chapter since many cloud customers forget taking this into account when adopting cloud providers. Therefore, it is needed for cloud customers to consider the lock-in effects that cause vendor lock-in to try to avoid them, where the risk is being tied to a particular cloud service provider due to the difficulty and costs of switching to another cloud provider to use the equivalent cloud services [18].\n\nCloud computing often relates to data, application, platform, and infrastructure components. Data is the machine-processable representation of information, which is found in the computer storage [17]. Applications are software programs that perform functions that are related to business problems [17]. Platforms are programs that support the applications and perform generic functions that are not business-related. Infrastructure is a collection of physical computation, storage, and communication resources [17].\n\nPortability\n\nPortability is the ability to move applications, data, and tools from one cloud provider to another so that it is usable in the target provider. This is found in a company that wants to adopt a cloud provider such as like Scania IT. There are several types of portability such as data, application and platform portability.\n\nInteroperability\n\nIEEE [20] and ISO [21] define interoperability as the ability for public clouds, private clouds or other more systems within a company to exchange information and mutually use the information that has been exchanged.\n\nIn cloud computing, the most important thing with interoperability is the ability of cloud customers' service to interact with cloud provider services and be able to communicate with the components on both sides [18]. They usually interact and communicate using a specific interface or an API. The problem is that cloud providers have different interfaces for each cloud service, which deal with different functions for example administration interfaces, billing interfaces, and many more interfaces. There are many types of interoperability such as application interoperability, platform interoperability and management interoperability.\n\nCloud Federation\n\nFederation is when several cloud providers are brought together to create a solution for a company. Federation is referred to the unionization of software, infrastructure and platform services from different networks that are accessed by the customer though the internet [35]. Federation of the cloud resources are facilitated through network gateways that connect public or external clouds, private or internal clouds to create a hybrid cloud computing environment.\n\n5.2 Vendor lock-in types in relation to different cloud models\n\nVendor lock-in is a risk that companies need to take into consideration when adopting a cloud provider. The risk can be found in different cloud service models, in IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. The risk varies greatly depending on the cloud service model as shown in the figure 5-1. This depends greatly on the number of hardware and software the vendor provides to the customer.\n\nFigure 5-1 The risk level of different cloud service models\n\nIaaS depends on the specific infrastructure services that are used. For example, if the customer uses cloud storage, they will not be impacted by the non-compatible virtual machine formats [36]. IaaS vendor lock-in has the lowest risk involved because most vendors use the same virtualization environments, which makes it easier for customers to move between cloud providers [29].\n\nThe risk increases with PaaS, since the vendor providers both hardware and software applications [29]. PaaS lock-in occurs at both the API layer and at the component level. For example, PaaS providers offers highly efficient back-end data store, that makes forces customer to develop code using the custom APIs offered by the provider and code data access routines in a way that is compatible with the back-end data store [36]. Accordingly, even if the APIs that are offered are compatible, the access model may be different, making the code unportable across PaaS providers. Moreover, PaaS lock-in at the API layer happens as different providers offer different APIs. Finally, the highest risk is with SaaS, since the vendor controls all the key components of the customers system [29].\n\n0\n\n15\n\n30\n\n45\n\n60\n\n75\n\nIaaS PaaS SaaS\n\nHigh risk\n\nLow risk\n\n6. Is Scania IT vulnerable to vendor lock-in?\n\nThis chapter is concluding whether Scania IT is vulnerable to vendor lock-in and gathering information that can be used to evaluate why Scania IT might be vulnerable. This is done by analyzing the cloud provider they want to adopt, which is Microsoft Azure and having an interview to a similar company, in such of the same motivation to use cloud computing, and the current components that are being used. This analysis has been done to learn what the greatest challenge to make this move was and how they handled the vendor lock-in situation.\n\n6.1 Microsoft Azure view on vendor lock-in\n\nIt was mainly focused on the lock-in effects and how a company falls in vendor lock-in. The issues that can be concluded from the meeting was that vendor lock-in should be included in a risk analysis of any company and vendor lock-in is valid regardless of whether the system is running on a physical data room of an organization or in a public cloud service such as Azure.\n\nAzure is a platform with very many different services where it varies how easy it is to move in a solution. In Azure, they are always working to minimize the lock-in effects. Azure's Cloud OS strategy is built to be able to manage their platforms in the same way as if it is on-premises, a partner cloud provider or in Azure. In Azure IaaS deals mostly with virtual machines and these are simple to be copied to other environments, i.e. no more vendor lock-in than the equivalent in its own or partner's hall. Maybe even less as Azure have well-defined public APIs. When it comes to various PaaS services, so it varies how easy it is to migrate. Everything is going to migrate but the thing to consider is how big or small the stakes are. For example Azure websites are very easy to move to a regular web server on premises.\n\n6.2 Relation between Company X and vendor lock-in Company X1 begin their thoughts of the transition of cloud computing and the most convenient provider was Microsoft Azure, since the company only used Microsoft components. Company X decided not to put everything in the cloud. But accordingly to the information classifications and how important the information is and whether it is dependent on another application or not, they would decide whether it is applicable to be put in the cloud. After choosing the most convenient\n\n1\n\nCompany X is an international company that wanted to stay anonymous due to their privacy concerns\n\ncloud provider, they had a testing period through which a practical test of cloud services was made and evaluation of what would the shift mean for the organization?\n\nThey found that the usage of the cloud gave them:\n\n1) Better user experience.\n\n2) They could store information that is accessible to the other branches in the company in other countries.\n\n3) Web acceleration is more effective with continues loading of new process and information.\n\n4) The same process is shared to everyone in the company.\n\nHowever, some of the concerns that made the people responsible on the transition make more efforts in examining is both security issues with a public cloud and the risk of falling into vendor lock-in. In order to decrease this risk of vendor lock-in, the company thought of the idea of mirroring. This following described method was conducted to be independent on a specific cloud provider and decrease the vulnerability to fall in vendor lock-in by making an own copy of the cloud internally offering the same services with the public cloud they have bought services that are non-vendor proprietary components such as SQL Server, Oracle, Tomcat, JBoss, IIS, Apache, etcetera that can either run:\n\n1. In IaaS cloud, where the company take care of them but run them on an instance in the cloud or spin up a complete \"image\" of the IaaS provider's application list.\n\n2. At PaaS provider, where the components are handled by the provider and is running on one of their servers, such as Oracle, IBM and others have this kind of PaaS based on standard products that can also be run at home in a company's own data center or in the company's own data centers (in private IaaS, PaaS or traditional IT).\n\nHowever Proprietary PaaS components such as Azure Blobs, Tables Azure, Azure Machine Learning, Azure Message Bus, etcetera, or AWS corresponding components can only be used in the provider's data center and you cannot move the applications that use them either to another cloud or home to the companies own data center. With this solution, the company can save data on-premises but in case of crashing there will be no way to run the data without creating an application that can take out data. Therefore company X choose to buy non-vendor proprietary cloud that is handled by the provider and based on standard components. The PaaS services are mapped in both internal and external IaaS to achieve mirroring and redundancy. Also, in case of a crash or that the operator agreement is no longer suitable. There is always a copy of data available on-premises. This is\n\nillustrated in figure 6-1. Each application (App) has a runtime environment to make the customer have the possibility to stop and restart the environment as seen in the figure 6-1.\n\nFigure 6-1 The method that can be used to minimize the risk of vendor lock-in\n\nSome characteristic that need to be applied in both the internal and external cloud are:\n\n• Resource management: for IaaS in cloud computing offers benefits such as scalability, quality of service, optimal utility, reduced overheads, improved throughput, reduced latency, specialized environment, cost effectiveness and simplified interface [22]. Also customer demands services and features and gets an environment in public or private cloud depending on current available resources.\n\n• Automated provisioning: it is the ability to deploy information technology by using predefined procedures that are carried out electronically without human intervention [23].\n\n• Adapters for different providers: it is the ability that makes different software's to transfer information from a local office to different cloud providers.\n\n6.3 Is Scania IT Vulnerable in the transition to the cloud?\n\nThe most important question was whether Scania IT is vulnerable in the transition to the cloud was analyzed through the previous case study mentioned and the view of the cloud provider. It can be seen from the case study of the similar company previous situation before adopting the cloud, it can be seen the similarities in both companies. Scania IT is also an international company that has the same motivation to use the cloud, which is global accessibility, that the same process can be shared to everyone in the company. Moreover continuous delivery importance can be thought to be helped by the cloud through web acceleration in loading of new process and information. The decrease of time to market was an important factor to both companies, company X and Scania IT. All these factors made it interesting to learn from company X the ways they tried to solve issues with the cloud. Their main issues were security and the fear of vendor lock-in. However our main focus was on vendor lock-in and their perspective on solving it. The study has shown the way to minimize the risk of vendor lock-in by providing two Infrastructure services both internally in Scania IT and externally in the cloud provider. However, another factor that needs to be considered is the Cloud Maturity Index (CMI), how mature Scania IT is in cloud computing services. Therefore figure 6-2 below shows the different factors that have been considered to set Scania IT in Stage 1 in CMI.\n\nFigure 6-2 Cloud Maturity Index and the current situation of Scania CV AB\n\nIn stage 1 (Immature): The cloud services are not used at all or very little. There is no strategy for the cloud services and the level of knowledge and ability is low. Finally there is no application consolidation, which means there is no strategy about the amount applications should move to the cloud. It is an important factor, since it decreases the number of vendors you deal with, and the number of licenses or home-built apps you manage, which can reduce complexity.\n\nIn stage 2 (Basic): There is a basic knowledge of cloud services. The use of services is purchased when the need arises and very little integration to other IT environment without a strategy.\n\nIn stage 3 (Mature): There is a strategy for cloud services and purchases are partially in accordance with it. There is probably more than one type of cloud service and perhaps more than one distribution model used. Cloud services are a natural part of the IT portfolio.\n\nIn stage 4 (Leading): The differences between cloud services and other forms of delivery are clearly defined. It includes whether an analysis of the existing IT portfolio has been implemented. Purchase of cloud services is in accordance with a defined strategy. Several types of cloud services and distribution models are used, depending on what is best for each area. The drivers of cloud services is particularly change, innovation and development. After the detailed view of the stages, the author of the report views Scania IT as in stage 1, since there is no use of cloud services yet. Moreover there is no defined strategy of the applications needed to move to the cloud. However it can be concluded that stage 3 can be reached fast and easily if there is a cloud defined strategy and purchases are done according to that strategy.\n\nTo clarify the current strategies in Scania IT, a flowchart has been made in figure 6-3 to ease what is needed from organizations. To be able to create a strategy, an IT strategy must be clarified. Once that is done, companies need to set their applications to be cloud defined. Cloud defined means that the applications requirements are specified and clarified with which service model suits these applications. Another requirement is the application consolidation, which is to bring several applications together to benefit of the decrease of number of vendors the company would deal with, and the number of licenses or home-built apps the company manage, can reduce complexity. Finally the last point was to clarify which requirements are needed when moving application from on-premises to the cloud, whether there are any guidelines set in a company or not.\n\nIt has been concluded that within Scania IT there are few guidelines that state which applications are most suitable to be put on the cloud in terms of simplicity, flexibility and information classification. However there are some points missing such as the need for the applications, whether they will need IaaS, PaaS or SaaS. The number of application needed to move to the cloud. It can be seen in the flowchart in figure 6-3, with the \"No\" in cloud defined, that if Scania IT does not\n\nhave a fully defined cloud strategy, they should do it to decrease the risk of cloud immaturity, have power of negotiation when they have several cloud moving to the cloud and could request an own shell in the cloud from any cloud provider.\n\nFigure 6-3 Hybrid IT strategy steps needed to adopt a cloud computing platform\n\nThese guidelines that are listed below would minimize the risk of the usage of the cloud. It is advisable for companies to work with improving their strategies before using the cloud services. Some of the guidelines currently being looked at are listed in the next subsection.\n\nGuidelines\n\nScania IT has a Hybrid IT strategy focus that is managed by Strategic Architecture Council (SAC). SAC is a part of Scania's Enterprise Architecture Governance structure. This council is responsible for Principles and strategies, Enterprise Architecture Roadmap Strategic. Some guidelines and thought by Magnus Eriksson, who is a senior Enterprise and IT-Architect at the Enterprise Architecture Office in Scania IT AB. He has performed proactive strategy and technology investigations.\n\nThe guidelines that will be discussed below are still not accepted by the IT Development Meeting (ITDM), which is part of the Scania IT Technology Architecture decision structure. The meeting is facilitated by Scania Enterprise Architecture Office. They are responsible to accept and decide on new strategic plans.\n\nSimplicity Guidelines\n\nOne of the important features that should be considered when choosing a deployment model and IT architecture is Simplicity. Two factors are most important when considering deployment models, which are the number and complexity of integration, and location of data producer and consumer [31]. In case of the existence of both the producer and consumer of data for a particular system are internal itself adds unnecessary complexity to deploy the system externally and vice versa for a system with external producers and consumers [31]. As seen in figure 6-4, the high risk is noticed to be when many/complex integration are in a system and the producer and consumer are not externally , then it is not a good idea to put the system externally. Also there is high risk when the producer and consumer are internal, and the systems with some/normal integrations are put externally. In most other cases there is no risk or medium risk to put the system internal or external depending on the integration complexity. So to conclude, if both the producer and consumer of data for a particular system are internal it adds unnecessary complexity to deploy the system externally and vice versa for a system with external producers and consumers [31].\n\nProducer and consumer are external\n\nProducer external and consumer are Internal\n\nProducer internal and consumer are external\n\nProducer and consumer internal\n\nMany/comple x integrations\n\nExternal External External External\n\nInternal Internal Internal Internal\n\nSome/normal integrations\n\nExternal External External External\n\nInternal Internal Internal Internal\n\nFew/simple integrations\n\nExternal External External External\n\nInternal Internal Internal Internal\n\nGreen: Proceed. Take this as the default approach and move forward on the basis of why wouldn't you do it.\n\nAmber: Medium risk. Pause and review the options available moving forward on the basis of why would you do it.\n\nRed: High-risk and/or not a good fit. Stop and consider the implications carefully before proceeding.\n\nFigure 6-4 Complexity integrations in relation to whether the producer and consumer exist internally or externally.\n\nFlexibility Guidelines\n\nFlexibility, which is the main focus of our topic since it is related to portability of moving applications between cloud vendors with as little effort and cost as possible [31].\n\nTherefore, the following priorities of guidelines are essential to when buying or reusing components/systems [31]:\n\n1. Available for both internal and external deployment (outsourced, SaaS, PaaS or using IaaS). The greater the number of available external providers the better.\n\n2. Available for external deployment from two or more external provider (outsourced, SaaS, PaaS or deployable using IaaS). The greater the number of external providers the better\n\n3. Available only internally.\n\n4. Available only from one external provider.\n\nTo sum up, the priority is that several components/systems are found in both external and internal deployment models, with a great number of available external providers. Then for less priority the components/systems would be available only for several external providers. After that it is preferable that components/systems are available only internally rather than externally.\n\nInformation Security (ISEC) Guidelines\n\nThe information Classification in Scania IT is classified into four main classes:\n\n1. Secret\n\n2. Confidential\n\n3. Internal\n\n4. Public\n\nBoth Secret and Public are rarely used in Scania IT. However when choosing a deployment model, it can be stated that a high risk application that needs to carefully be looked into to whether move to a cloud or not is in the Secret class. While in the Confidential class, it is a medium risk and options of the external providers available must be examined properly. For both Internal and Public class, both external and internal deployment models are of no risk. This can be seen in figure 6-5 [31].\n\nConfidentiality Delivery Model\n\nSecret External\n\nInternal\n\nConfidential External\n\nInternal\n\nInternal External\n\nInternal\n\nPublic External\n\nInternal\n\nGreen: Proceed. Take this as the default approach and move forward on the basis of why wouldn't you do it.\n\nAmber: Medium risk. Pause and review the options available moving forward on the basis of why would you do it.\n\nRed: High-risk and/or not a good fit. Stop and consider the implications carefully before proceeding.\n\n6-5 Classifications of information types followed by their risk level [31]\n\nAccording to the strategies that were stated above it can be concluded that the hybrid IT cloud is the main focus of the company. It can be noted that \"Hybrid IT is transforming IT architectures and the role of IT itself\", according to Gartner, Inc. [32]. Hybrid IT is the result of combing traditional IT with Hybrid Cloud, which can include public clouds, private clouds and community clouds. Hybrid\n\nIT is new and IT organization such as Scania IT need to use a hybrid IT strategy that not only build internal clouds to house critical IT services but also utilities the external cloud to house noncritical IT services to minimize the risk of vendor lock-in by having both internal and external applications, data and information. Also further strategies are needed to minimize vulnerabilities that cause companies to fall in vendor lock-in and in the same way take the advantages that the cloud would give the company.\n\n7. Conclusion, Implications and Future work\n\nThis final chapter concludes and summarizes the study conducted in Scania CV AB with the goal to help Scania IT understand the vendor lock-in and the vulnerabilities they can face in the transition to the cloud. Then further work is clarified with ideas of how the work can progress.\n\n7.1 Conclusion\n\nScania CV AB has a history over 100 years. Throughout the years, Scania has delivered heavy transport and buses with continuous development and innovations. The goal of the thesis was to emphasize the reason why Scania IT needs to consider the deployment of a cloud computing platform and to help Scania IT understand the vulnerabilities towards vendor lock-in in the transition to the cloud as well as to clarify the concern that they may have against falling in vendor lock-in and show what can be done to decrease the risks of cloud computing. The following was the research questions that were researched in the thesis.\n\n(1)  Why is cloud computing a raised issue in Scania IT?\n\n(2)  Why is Scania IT vulnerable to vendor lock-in in the transition to a cloud computing platform?\n\n(3)  Why is vendor lock-in a concern to Scania IT when using a cloud computing platform?\n\nThe requirement of a cloud computing platform was needed to minimize the lead-time caused in the current development process. The cloud computing platform is the technology where the servers and applications are hosted on the internet rather than internally on premises. The advantages of a cloud computing platform is flexibility, innovation, development and less IT costs that are due to reduced amount of physical infrastructure that they have to keep and maintain. There are several characteristics of the cloud, which are service models IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. Also a set of deployment models public cloud, virtual private cloud, private cloud and hybrid cloud that can be chosen from. These characteristics can be chosen depending on the companies' requirement that\n\nthey have set on their applications. The development process that Scania IT is going through all the way to production was to conclude the bottlenecks that Scania IT was facing and the benefits of moving the cloud.\n\nMost companies like Scania IT have seen the advantages and positive side of moving to the cloud and the ways into the cloud, but never have taken into consideration the ways out of the cloud. Therefore the study was mainly focused on the vulnerabilities causing vendor lock-in, which is the situation that causes companies to be locked to a specific cloud provider and moving to another provider will cause the company to pay significant switching costs. The situation of vendor lock-in was examined by analyzing a similar company with the same criteria and motivation to move to the cloud and from that analysis, it was concluded that vendor lock-in can be minimized by creating two infrastructures as a service, one internally and one externally to have duplicate of the data and avoiding using proprietary cloud provider components. Other risks were taken into account and that was the cloud maturity index (CMI) and how mature Scania IT can be seen in cloud computing. The conclusion was that Scania IT needs to improve their knowledge about cloud services and decide which cloud deployment model is most appropriate to their companies business. The index of cloud maturity is an important factor since companies with high CMI has in average 34 % less costs for IT and spend three times more on innovation and development.\n\nMoreover it could be concluded that the most suitable deployment model is the Hybrid IT, instead of only using one development model. Thus the benefits and limitations of all deployment models are taken. However a study of the Hybrid IT strategies in Scania IT is needed to evaluate how mature Scania IT is in cloud computing. Strategies has shown that deploying the Infrastructure with the help of the cloud, is the much more beneficial for Scania IT than to deploy platform services, which will increase their risk to vendor lock-in and would not give so huge gain in the company but more risk.\n\nScania IT needs to consider the risk of vendor lock-in and the lock-in effects as portability, interoperability and federation that causes the applications not to be runnable at another cloud provider. By solving the lock-in effects, the company is minimizing the vendor lock-in since that is solving portability of data from one cloud provider to another, or interoperability, that the applications from different vendors are communicating to each other or federation, where different applications from different providers form a solution for a company.\n\nHowever, it might be necessary to first move the data back to the customer's site and then move it to the new provider's environment using a data migration plan. In this migration plan, there must be a way to switch data format and syntax to another form to be suitable to be used by another provider. Since Scania IT is a huge international company with much valuable data and information, it would be recommended according to their classification of data to avoid putting any secret or confidential data on the cloud. The companies as Scania IT need to study and research all the cloud possibilities with the advantages and disadvantages of the cloud to avoid falling in vendor lock-in. Also by reaching a leading stage in the CMI that can help the company be aware of all the cloud elements, risks and follow a defined strategy. The vulnerabilities that Scania IT can face towards vendor lock-in is lack of standard technologies and solutions, poor provider selection, lack of supplier redundancy, lack of completeness and transparency in terms of use. Since all the cloud providers want to lock their customers to their own components and do not support standardization of technologies and solutions. Also, cloud providers do not provide all the information to their customer which contributes to lack of transparency.\n\n7.2 Implications for Scania IT\n\nScania CV AB is an international company, which seeks innovations and continuous development in their trucks and buses for heavy transport work. As stated before the study was particularly done in Scania IT, which is the part of Scania CV AB that is responsible for the development of the applications and their infrastructure.\n\nTheir need for the cloud was concluded from their bottlenecks that were derived from the development process. The study clarified the need for the cloud for Scania IT and made them realize the advantages of the movement of the cloud. However, the cons of the cloud as vendor lock-in was noticed as a risk for the company that they fear in using cloud computing. Despite of this fear, the clarifications of the different lock-in effects were helpful for Scania IT to understand what they need to discuss with cloud providers. Furthermore Scania IT needs to further work on the steps for their exit strategy of moving out of the cloud computing platform if needed.\n\nThe case study of company X that has similar characteristics as Scania IT, gave Scania IT a solution that would minimize the risk of vendor lock-in while maintaining the advantages of the cloud as flexibility and lower IT costs. Scania IT thought the idea of using two infrastructures as service was brilliant and would be minimize their concern about vendor lock-in as they would have their data on-premises. This is seen as an advantage since IaaS has a fixed fee that can expand easily with minimal operational and maintenance expenditure. So for a big company as Scania IT with 42,100 employees, it will be much easier to automate by saving on the public IaaS and a private IaaS to protect data either by security propose if the public cloud will have any break in or something and Scania IT wants to get their data or by the private cloud, where Scania IT can just take their data and use it on another PaaS.\n\nAnother important aspect for Scania IT was the cloud maturity index, that shows how mature a company is in using cloud computing. This index has shown Scania IT their current position and what is needed for them to reach a higher mature stage and minimize their risks. This index led to the discussion whether Scania IT has a cloud defined strategy. Cloud defined strategy was an important issue for Scania IT to follow in order to reach their goal to use cloud computing platform.\n\n7.3 Future work\n\nCloud computing is a broad developing topic with a lot of room for further research and analysis. There are two approaches for future work, one for Scania IT and one for general researchers.\n\nFor Scania IT, this study concludes an overview for the reasons that can cause the company Scania IT to think about the usage of cloud computing platform and the risk of vendor lock-in. This work can be continued in different aspects. One of these aspects is to further study the Hybrid IT strategies in terms of the applications needed to move to the cloud. Besides that, they need to consider each application requirement, whether it requires the implementation of IaaS, PaaS or SaaS. Another aspect that needs further research is the guideline of different cloud provider in terms of their offering for portability and interoperability of data and applications.\n\nFor general researchers, this study is the ways to minimize the risk of vendor lock-in and strategies that can be worked upon to achieve a higher leading CMI. This work can be continued by evaluating the different cloud provider's capabilities of offerings for portability and interoperability.\n\nAlso, to further look into further solutions of vendor lock-in and the new technologies and standardization techniques that are striving to make vendor lock-in a decreased risk for companies.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Scania.
